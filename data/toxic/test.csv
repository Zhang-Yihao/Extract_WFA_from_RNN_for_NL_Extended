I'll clear the air here before I continue upon the current situation. 

I feel like I am being painted as the bad guy here, and that my editing and/or the editing of others is considered to be an American POV. I quote 

 Yet it was apparently Americans who started this article.

For the record. Yes I started this article. No I am not American. Such accusations that I am American and therefore my stance at maintaining the American ratings is of a POV nature are not only unfounded but unfair.

Secondly in regards to the link and image. This is no place to discuss such an issue here to begin with, and bringing it up in this situation is simply adding fuel to the fire. Furthermore it is simply a slap in the face given that just hours prior to your post I had re-opened dialogue asking for help choosing 1 of 4 new images for the infobox located here: Talk:Rookie Blue#New_Image. Since you have brought this up I have no choice but to defend myself and the editors involved about violations of NPOV. The items in question were added in this edit:  at 23:08, 17 May 2010. At the time of the edit the only available material was from the ABC. I refer you to the following two links. The first will show that the ABC Rookie Blue website was indexed on the 28 Apr 2010. The second link will show that the GlobalTV Rookie Blue website was indexed on the 12 Jun 2010. Hell I will even used google.ca:

ABC:
http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&lr;=&tbs;=qdr%3Ay&q;=%22http%3A%2F%2Fabc.go.com%2Fshows%2Frookie-blue%22&aq;=f&aqi;=&aql;=&oq;=&gs;_rfai=

Global:
http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&lr;=&tbs;=qdr%3Ay&q;=%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globaltv.com%2Frookieblue%2Findex.html%22&aq;=f&aqi;=&aql;=&oq;=&gs;_rfai=

As you can see Logical_Fuzz did no wrong as the material from Global was not available to him/her till nearly a month later. As far as I know Logical_Fuzz is in the North American region. Specifically what nationality I am unsure of, but his/her edits were made in good faith and not in an American POV. Any further allegations that state me or other editors that have contributed to this article or the main article have violated NPOV, without proper proof backing those allegations; will not be met with too kindly.

Third. I was the one who added that is was a Canadian police drama (evidence here: ) as I accept it is a mainly a Canadian production. If I wanted to I could easily say it was a Canadian-American production. This should further dispel any such allegations that I am in violation of NPOV.

Now on with what I am to say. As I said I accept that this is mainly a Canadian Production. The page says Canadian but it also says the following:

 The series is a joint venture between Canwest Broadcasting and ABC, and produced by E1 Entertainment.

Given that Canwest also put out a joint announcement with the ABC () renewing Rookie Blue for a second season, I think it is fair to say a joint venture doesn't mean that anything American immediately takes a back seat. In regards to the """"Do not add foreign broadcasters here"""" comment. I am confused. Are you suggesting we remove the ABC as the original channel? Or have you just read it wrong and trying to argue that the picture and website don't below because it says """"Do not add foreign broadcasters here""""?

Read the first sentence of this whole exchange.

""""I do not have a problem with adding Canadian Ratings to the table but here are my concerns"""" 

I respectfully decline to participate in the MOS discussion for now.

"""Crown corporations ==
VIA Rail is a not a true Crown Corporation in that it cannot raise funds on the money market, rather it is subject to the whims of the government of the day for its ongoing funding. This is a major reason for the failure of VIA to improve its lot.

True enough regarding how political control limits the company's """"viability"""" (pun intended!), however the definition of a Crown corporation throughout Canada's history has been fairly broad.  In the sense that any publicly owned (ie. government) company in Canada is a Crown corporation, then VIA Rail would meet that criteria.  For many years prior to its recapitalization in the late 1970's and the Canadian railway industry's deregulation in the 1980's, CN was not allowed to raise funds either.  Provincial Crown corporations like B.C. Rail and B.C. Ferries or N.B. Power were similarly limited at certain points in their existence.  I could be wrong, as I have not read the VIA Rail Act in-depth but is there a specific provision which limits the company from seeking funds on the """"money market"""" in the way you describe?  I would also argue that there is likely no public transport company in the world which is financially successful in the limited way in which economists in the 20th/21st century measure this.  Since there is no accounting taken for the numbers of vehicles taken off a nation's highways each day, or having to construct new roads to isolated communities served by VIA/Amtrak/etc., or the environmental benefits realized, etc. etc. etc. then VIA Rail, Amtrak, Eurorail, various ferries, etc. will never be financially solvent.  Cheers,  22:00, 31 Jul 2004 (UTC)

The following section was added by User: Andrew Dunning and I have commented it out pending input from others due to several errors:

Officially, the move from the CP to CN line was to keep service to more remote communities on the CN line. However, this move was seen as somewhat more politically-motivated by some. Coincidentally, the CN route goes through more towns that voted Progressive Conservative. Harvey André, the Cabinet minister who represented Calgary in 1990, was fairly public about the fact that he did not care if he never saw a train again in his life. The CN line also went through Edmonton, the home of both Mulroney and Joe Clark.

No doubt politics played a heavy role in this 2nd round of VIA cuts, however I'm unsure as to what the actual political representation played throughout the Super Continental's route (historically, the Super was a CN transcontinental train, and The Canadian was a CP transcontinental train).  In the 1990 cuts when VIA was reduced to a single transcontinental, they decided to keep the more-recognized Canadian brand, and use it on the CN line... why the CN line is the question, however some have suggested CN being a crown corp at the time, gave VIA a better deal on trackage fees, insurance costs, etc. etc.  Politics could also have played a role, or perhaps the thinking was that VIA should be supporting the feds to provide service to the more remote northern prairie communities since the Trans-Canada Highway follows the southerly CP route and was already well-served by inter-city busses.  The main reason I've commented out the above addition was the last line concerning Clark & Mulroney's ridings - Clark represented High River near Calgary, Alberta in the 1980s and Mulroney represented Manicouagan near Baie Comeau, Quebec.  Harvey André...  I have no idea - very likely though.  Once this part gets edited/verified properly, it should appropriately be added to the story surrounding the 2nd round of cuts in 1990. 16:57, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Joe Clark was born and raised in High River, but he represented Yellowhead, a large riding between Edmonton and Jasper, from 1979 to 1993. Mulroney never lived in Alberta, nor was he ever an Alberta MP. 17:30, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Locomotive roster

The roster is a dog's breakfast of past and present with nothing to distinguish between. Use of """"streamline"""" to describe ex CPR Budd built stainless steel equipment is a questionable term. This whole section needs some serious work.

 21:33, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Yeah, this is definitely a mess.  Before I put some time in cleaning it up, would anyone like to weigh in as to whether they'd like to see this sort of information in this article?  For Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway we've resisted having the roster in the article, but VIA Rail might be different because (a) its locomotive count is in the dozens, not the thousands and (b) it's a bit easier to compile a complete roster since VIA's under 30 years old.

WP:Neutral point of view, which Peridon mentioned,
WP:Verifiability: """"all quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable, published source... The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—whether readers can check that material in Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether editors think it is true.""""
WP:No original research: """"The term """"original research"""" (OR) is used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published source exists.""""

Good morning....

 Civility and stuff 

Regarding my last WP:FOOTY input, i have already replied you there. Here, i'll only add, other than a second apology to you, WP, WP:FOOTY and (some of) those concerned with some of the contents of my input: i can cope with being called """"stupid"""" (what's intelligence anyway), but VILE? Please think about what you wrote as well my friend.

Attentively -   
The events of the last week have been very disturbing and I was offended by what you said, so I can only imagine how someone who lost a loved one would've reacted to your comment. As I said before, think about what you write before you click that save button. Comparing a cheating footballer to a mass murder is wrong. talk 

I'll try to """"defend"""" myself once again, as i feel i did not manage it the last time around: i only chose that comparison to illustrate the level of vandalism occurring in the footballer's page (i did not compare anyone, i merely """"reasoned"""" - or did not! - if this occurs in a mere footballer page, what can be done with a real scumbag like that mass murderer and the ones like him), i only chose a very unfortunate example to guide me by. I guess you are very upset at me, and there's nothing i can say at this moment to """"turn back the tide"""", so i'll just be quiet for now...

No friends in real life, still have time to make enemies in the virtual world, even though i intend just the opposite -   
You don't have to apologise to me, I'm not going to hold it against you. It was an off the cuff remark and we all make them. If you look at the editing history of Sam Deering you will see an expansion I made after answering a request to do so. I found something unsavoury that he said during his time at Oxford United and in my edit summary I made a comment about his intellect, which I shouldn't have. You do a lot of great work around here and I have no beef with you, so don't worry about it. talk

"To KF
To User KF: Don't try to reason with Doc. He's unreasonable, a definite case of head in cement syndrome and possible abuse of his authority by just deleting without being sure of his right to act summarily. I noticed he's had more of his administrative decisions reversed by other administrators, most notably Remember the dot reversing him most recently than any other admin so far as I've seen. So just ignore him and reinstate the article with the tags you propose. He does anything to it again, either you can complain against him to the Arbitration Committee or to a more reasonable administrator for reversal of all his or her decisions. Judicial action would be a last resort if internal processes fail to produce a satisfactory result, but it's always a possibility. But go to User Remember the dot, he or she will likely give you a fair hearing, more fair than you get here. I imagine this guy will want to block me for this, but if he does, well I'll just appeal to the above named administrator, or sue him before an arbitration hearing here, or if needed as a very last resort, judicial action.   

To Doc
To whom Doc is: I advise KF to ignore your actions and denials of petition and just reinstate the article you deleted in its original terms and add the tags he proposes him or herself. If you delete it again, I advised him to complain against you before administrator Remember the dot to overturn your adverse to KF decisions or go to the Arbitration Committee with a complaint and if as a last resort, bring judicial action against you. Your abuse needs to be stopped. You seem mean spirited, crude and abusive of your power. I figure you're going to try to block me. If you do, I'll appeal to Remember the dot or Arb Comm, or last resort legal options which is something I don't relish doing, but is always a last card to play I suppose.",0

RE: Carter and Apartheid -  The article should mention that he was not plowing new ground.
More than one Jewish - Israeli """"historian"""" - real historians, really - preceded him
in the discovery that Israel acts just like South Africa did. I was surprised to see
the indignation expressed when Carter's book was first released. I thought then, and
still do, that it was feigned indignation for press consumption only. Without knowing
who expressed their hurt feelings - I bet I can guess as to who at least a half dozen
of the usual suspects are, sight unseen.

Of course there are indeterminates in the real numbers - can you provide a complete representation in *any* number system for those numbers we call irrational? The answer is no. Even if it were possible for 0.999... to equal 1, it breaks the decimal system as it was intended since its invention. Do you agree that not all real numbers can be represented in a radix system? If yes, why would you insist on having a cauchy sequence define a number?  Just because you can list the first few terms says nothing about the limit. For example, you can provide a Cauchy sequence that 'represents' pi but you cannot find its limit. There are several contradictions in this branch of 'analysis' - All Cauchy sequences must have limits but you cannot find the actual limit of 'most' Cauchy sequences that represent the majority of real numbers you cannot represent completely.

"""== Forbes Magazine's """"Most Powerful"""" Ranking ==

There is an increasing number of Forbes Magazine references appearing in the leading paragraphs of biographical wiki pages.  The opening paragraphs of a wiki page should contain important details, not subjective trivia.  Forbes 'most powerful' ranking is merely one American magazine editor's perceived and unsupported opinion as to each well-known person's 'power'.  By rights it should not appear on any wiki page other than the Forbes magazine page or Forbes Magazine ranking page.
It appears the less powerful an important person or celebrity is, the more likely (s)he is to have a Forbes ranking on their wiki page.  Truly powerful people do not.  For example:
Barack Obama (President, USA) - No mention of Forbes ridiculous ranking on his page
Vladimir Putin (Prime Minister, Russia) - No mention of Forbes
Dmitry Medvedev (President, Russia) - No mention of Forbes
David Cameron (Prime Minister, United Kingdom) - No mention of Forbes
Benjamin Netanyahu (Prime Minister, Israel) - No mention of Forbes
Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (King, Saudi Arabia) - No mention of Forbes
Nicolas Sarkozy (President, France) - No mention of Forbes
Ali Khamenei (Supreme Leader, Iran) - No mention of Forbes
Naoto Kan (Prime Minister, Japan) - No mention of Forbes
Ashfaq Parvez Kayani (Chief of Army Staff, Pakistan) - No mention of Forbes
So why do the Forbes rankings keep appearing all over wiki?  Is there a wiki rule to stop the magazine from obtaining free advertising at wiki's expense?
  
Sorry but what does this have to do with the main page? (Also while I have no opinion on whether Forbes ratings belong it hardly seems surprising that the less 'powerful' and important person or celebrity is, the more likely they are to have a Forbes rating. You don't need a Forbes rating to tell you Barack Obama is important. You just need to words, 'President of the United States'. The same with all the rest you mentioned.)   

Why do Forbes Magazine's unsubstantiated rankings garner support on wiki?  They are obviously fabricated.  Many are rubbish.  For example, Forbes rank Michelle Obama as the most powerful woman in the world.  Yet it is Barack who is the president, not Michelle.  As 'First Lady' Michelle has no power whatsoever.
How about the number 2 'ranked' woman?  It is an American food saleswoman (Irene Rosenfeld).  What complete baloney.  Number 3 is an American television host (Oprah Winfrey), and finally at number 4 is a woman with real power, the Chancellor of Germany (Angela Merkel).  Forbes incredibly has ranked an American grocer and an American television host above a head of government.
My question is, why does a supposedly factual encyclopaedia (wiki) rate worthy of mention the suppositions and meanderings of a magazine that specialises in listening to gossip rather than in researching facts?
  

So what does this have to do with the main page?
If you don't think the information belongs in articles the place to discuss that is on the talk page of the effected articles.  You could also be bold and remove it and explain why.  If another editor reverts you then you are into the bold, revert, discuss cycle and you know who to discuss it with.
The discussion does not belong here because it has nothing to do with the main page and that is what this page is for.   fan ~~ 
And if you do want discussion somewhere in a more centralised page, the big header has suggestions. Perhaps start at WP:VPP

Bill,

I don't find your un-edits a gender-based attack.  I am largely concerned with the content of the article itself, but I wonder why you put up so much opposition to my very small edit.  Surely it can't mean that much to you.

I don't want to make derogatory comments about men.  I have nothing against men, and I don't enjoy tearing people down.  You mention the term """"well-referenced"""".  I prefer for statements to be well-referenced too.  I don't think that this particular statment is well-referenced, and furthermore, I don't think that it can be well-referenced, because I don't think that it is true.  And so I wonder about the author's neutrality.  Wikipedia articles are supposed to be both neutral and well-edited, and that statement is neither.

I don't want the article to be deleted either.  I think that it serves a useful purpose, and I enjoyed reading it.  I just want to do away with that particular sentence.

Of course, if you can find evidence that American women are materialistic sluts, then we have no problem at all.  But I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote that was confusing personal opinion for universal truth.

"Hi Elen, apart from chewing your ear for the first deletion tag I have generally seen your own actions as even handed and I would extend this comment to a few of the other editors, all who disagreed with my view but after seeing how Wikipedia works internally I confess to being little else than disgusted at the sheer stupidity involved and I point that criticism at the mechanics of the successful removal of the page stub for JWASM I bothered to write for Wikipedia. The same antagonist tried to trash the MASM page that I rewrote earlier and from his comments in its talk page it is only a matter of time until he does it again. An earlier editor tried to get some content into the MASM page by scouring the MASM32 web site and linking to web pages that I wrote for the masm32 user base and while I was willing to tolerate this and did a reasonable amount of work on the MASM page to try and get it up to date and relevant so it was no longer needed, in the face of endless obstruction I will simply resolve the problem from outside Wikipedia.

I will notify Dr. Delso tommorrow and I will be recommending some other on-line project for us to pursue.

I have been out most of the day and have reviewed what's gone on here on this site since I have been out with my wife and son.  I have asked Marty (mmartin) to cease in posting me to this section or this article, and to be honest, while it strokes my ego a great deal, I cannot support a sewer site like this one based upon what I have seen go on here.  I am a member of the Nation but I am not going to post private information to this site, or allow  this """"lynch mob"""" mentality to go on here, nor do I have to image my tribal card and post it to the internet to satisfy some anonymous poster from Australia.  I have had several conversations over the past week with user:Jimbo_Wales about the activities that go on with this site, and at this point, I am going to recommend to Dr. Delso at the Cherokee Nation education department at the Nation that I cease my support of this site.  I had intended and begun a full tutorial on our language and had already begun it with the translations and cultural information section.  In short, user:Jimbo_Wales WORD IS NO GOOD and he is a LIAR.  He gave me his assurances that these types of attacks would not go on here, but what has happened in the SCOX message board has basically moved to this site and have continued their stalking and harrassment and it has continued unabated.  At this point, this in not constructive for my people or my culture to support an organization that simply allows """"thundering herd"""" libel and personal attacks on individuals, reverts and defacement of information, and the so-called """"admins"""" of this site are just as immature, if not more so, than the persons engaging in libel.  As such, I am reverting and removing and marking for deletion all content I have contributed to date.  I have been very unimpressed with the people on this site running it.

The following comments have been deleted:

The band promotes Croatian patriotism and ultra-nationalism, and sings about topics such as the love for one's country, family and religion, but also about the hatred of Serbs and Croatian social democrats. Dealing with such topics has made the band controversial. Perković has been known to openly promote Ustaša ideology because he wears black clothes, salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the Ustaše and the NDH in his statements to the media. 

Ultra-nationalism?Ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation.While patriotism means that you love your own nation,but you respect others.Where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations?And no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbs,because it was the time of war.And only mention songs written by him.Not what he is accused of performing.

 Hatred toward SDP?Where?Name source.He is right wing,that si widely known.Of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatia,but hatred? Reliable source please.

Where does he promote openly Ustashe?Citation please.Because he wears black clothes?Are all rockers Ustashe?By this,rock 'n' roll is equal fascism.He is a rock singer,of course he wears black clothes.
Salute he uses is an old salute of Croatian nobles,that existed long before Ustashe.

Despite this, his statements confirming his support for the Ustaše actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual NSDAP equivalent (he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the NDH, in various degrees, to the media on at least twenty occasions). His credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning (or other legal action).

Again,I see that this is already discussed.Feral is not reliable,its a tabloid.Only reliable newspapers should be used.And these quotations in Feral,while they may be true,there are no links to check the meaning,because they may be taken out of contest,and they could have totally fifferent meaning ii their original contest.This is not reliable.

And one more question.A couple of months ago I translated two Perkovic's statements in Jutarnji list and Vecernji list.I've put relevant sources,links to that articles.And a picture was there also.Someone deleted all this without giving explanation on the discussion page.This is not what wikipedia is about.Any change must be explained.Shame on anyone who uses this kind of sneaky methods.",1

So if his critic is in any way or form relevant, why not settle it once for all and end with austrians, or if he doesn't want to lose his time on irrelevant things, he has humanitarian incentive (or why call out austrians in a first place?)...  So all in all, it comes to this, either criticizer and critic is irrelevant and should be deleted, or what is in my opinion far better solution, this discrepancy should be there for readers to know and decide for themselves. This could be done in one or two sentences, just a note that he refuses the offer of debate from 2010 although 105 000$ fund for Food bank New York was established; + a link to site.

An event in this article is a April 30 selected anniversary (may be in HTML comment)

 A question has been bugging me 
From the time the first US military advisors stepped in to Vietnam in the early 60s to the final withdrawal of all US troops in 1973 the USSR and China repeatedly warned Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon NOT to cross the DMZ and directly invade North Vietnam. That seems simple enough that we were not allowed to go in to the North BUT my question is were the South Vietnamese Forces allowed to go on the offensive and invade North Vietnam? Did USSR and China ever warn the South not to invade the North? 

Considering the U.S.'s coordination with and funding for ARVN, I'm sure that they would take South Vietnamese ground forces in North Vietnam much the same way they'd take Marines. The only """"crossing of the DMZ"""" that occurred was American bombing raids.  
Probably not, but it is doubtful that such an operation could have been pulled off.  23 July 2005
It's hard to imagine what further threats the major communist powers could have used to dissuade S.V. from doing anything. But I agree with CJK, the limited competence of the ARVN in offensive operations seems well-established in the historical record, e.g. the offensive in Laos.  (talk) 03:04, 2005 July 24 (UTC)
The forgotten factor in this little chat is the fact that the South and its dissident """"South"""" Vietnamese were often the target of U.S. bombing. Keep in mind that the terms """"North"""" and """"South"""" were circumstantial, and not actually representative of the demographic split. """"North and South"""" often simply repeats the ideological and geographic claims about the nature of the war, which American soldiers, for example, found to be not the reality: Many (perhaps most) people in the """"democratic"""" South were pro-independence, despite the Western-allied/ethnic Catholic elite. Hence any use of """"North and South"""" carries an inherent biased disparity with the facts. -|t 
I don't know what you are talking about. We were discussing whether or not the Soviets or Chinese would react if South Vietnam sent its forces to invade North Vietnam.  24 July 2005
""""I dont know what you are talking about."""" Well, it would really help if you did, wouldnt it? -|t 
Well maybe you shouldn't bring up unrelated issues in the middle of a specific discussion.  25 July 2005
I'd just like to commend the recent additions to the article.  
Actually, to my understanding, there were still many rescue raids (of captured POWs) or commando attacks that were conducted by either U.S. commandos or the """"Biet Dong Quan"""" (the ARVN equivalent) against the north during the war. It's an honour to meet celebrities like you, Trey and Parker Stone. I appreciate your criticisms to my editions on the Vietnam War page. - .
well others watching this page are quite capable of RVing Marxist language and POV it seems.  
And would RVing 'capitalist language and POV' be ok with you? -|t 
I don't know what """"capitalist language"""" means, but if it existed and was POV then I would have no problems with its reversion.  
We were actually talking about a full scale attack by South Vietnam, not a raid.  24 July 2005

Let's assume the South Vietnamese Army, without US troop support, did gather a formidable invasion force and did cross the DMZ in to the North, would the Chinese and/or USSR intervene and play the """"defending an ally card"""" for the North exactly like how we did for the South?  
I know this is a hypothetical assumption, but still, it's irrelevant, because the ARVN was never able to operate well without U.S. assistance. So answering your hypothetical, if that did happen active intervention in the form of Chinese or Soviet troops would probably not be necessary given the PAVN's superior capabilities. if we had somehow managed to make the ARVN into a capable offensive force and we were able to take over North Vietnam then yes, I'd expect the PLA (army in China) to intervene just like they had in North Korea. but American go",0

Original article should be like this

 

Franjo Tuðman (May 14, 1922 - [[December
9]], 1999) was the first president of Croatia in
the 1990s.

Tuðman's political party HDZ (Hrvatska Demokratska
Zajednica, Croatian Democratic Union) won the first
post-communist multi-party elections in 1990 and
he became the president of the country. A year later he
proclaimed the Croatian declaration of independence. He
was reelected twice and remained in power until his death
in late 1999. In English, his surname is spelled
""""Tudjman"""".

The Communist

Franjo Tuðman was born in Veliko Trgovišæe, a village in
the Hrvatsko Zagorje region of northern Croatia.

During WWII Tuðman fought on the side of
Tito's partisans, where he
also met his future wife, Ankica. He became one of the
youngest generals in the Yugoslav People's Army in the
1960s — a fact which some observers linked to the
fact that he sprung from Zagorje, a region that gave few
Communist partisans.

Others have observed that Tuðman was probably the most
educated of Tito's generals (as regards military history,
strategy and the interplay of politics and warfare)
— this claim is supported by the fact that
generations of future Yugoslav generals based their
general exam theses on his voluminous book on guerilla
warfare throughout history: Rat protiv rata (""""War
against war""""), 1957, which covers topics as diverse as
Hannibal's drive across the Alps, the Spanish war
against Napoleon and Yugoslav partisan
warfare.

Tuðman left active army service in 1961 to found the
Institut za historiju radnièkoga pokreta Hrvatske
(""""Institute for the History of Croatia's Workers'
Movement""""), and remained its director until 1967.

The Dissident

Apart from the book on guerilla warfare, Tuðman wrote a
series of articles  attacking the Yugoslav
Communist establishment, and was
subsequently expelled from the Party. His most important
book from that period was Velike ideje i mali narodi
(""""Great ideas and small peoples""""), a monograph on
political history that collided with central dogmas of
Yugoslav Communist elite with regard to the
interconnectedness of the national and social elements in
the Yugoslav revolutionary war (during [[World War
II|WWII]]).

In 1971 he was sentenced to two years of prison for
alleged subversive activities during the so-called
""""Croatian Spring"""".

The Croatian Spring was a reformist movement that was
actually set in motion by Tito and Croatian party
chief Bakariæ in the climate of
growing liberalism in the late 60s. It was initially a
tepid and ideologically controlled party liberalism, but
it soon grew into mass manifestation of dissatisfaction
with the position of the Croatian people in
Yugoslavia, and it began to threaten the party's
political monopoly. The result was a brutal suppression by
Tito, who used the military and the police to crush
what he saw as the threat to his undivided power - Bakariæ
quickly distanced himself from the Croatian Communist
leadership that he himself helped gain power earlier, and
sided with the Yugoslav ruler.

During the turbulent 1971, Tuðman's role was that of the
dissident who questioned the central myth of modern
Serbian nationalism, the number of victims of
the Jasenovac concentration camp, as well as the role
of centralism in Yugoslav and the continuation of
ideology of unitary """"Yugoslavism"""". Tuðman felt that this
originally Croatian romantic pan-Slavic idea from the
19th century had been mutated in harsh realities in both
Yugoslav states into the front for a pan-Serbian drive for
domination over non-Serb peoples — from economy and

An authoritative work about nails, written by an expert on nails, and used as a textbook, or source for a textbook about nails, would get a lot of weight - we would regard it as definitive. A differing view from a nail manufacturer's website would get considerably less weight, as would a newspaper article about nails.

   Hey Einstein, when did I say anything anti-africanist here?? please point it out for me. I'm even against the CIA sources that some people wanted to place on the article here, the one about 73% mulatto,16% white and 11% black.  Do you think that I'm going to be crazy enough to believe DR is only 11% Black??  I'll be too ashamed of saying such a thing.  I agree on you on that one. 51% mulatto, 46% black, 2% white is the real demographic approximates of DR. Where is the """" denial, anti-black, blaha blah and all the non-sense accusations that you are making by me saying that??
   I stated an increase from 11% that somebody else place here from CIA to 46%, that's an increase of 35. So I am the anti-black, racist,denier??? 

   I knew that you where going to throw the """" Moor myth"""" about Spaniards, you are showing the radical afrocentric nut. What's next? you also believe in Van Sertima's book, that the Olmec heads of the Yucatan peninsula are Africans? or that snow is really black??
   DNA studies in Spaniards show that less than 2% have Moor blood. It has been weed out,since the fall of Cordova in 1236, by the """" limpieza de sangre"""" campaign of the christians. Spaniards are White as are the anglo-saxons,and the Irish. I'm not going into deep details about """" Moors and Spain"""" with a radical Afrocentric nut, but going back to the article, we are not going to allow that the DR article is going to get hijack by radical afrocentric nut, nor eurocentric too. As you can see, I'm not eurocentric, 16% white to 2% white, do the math.

Thanks.   Believe it or not in the real world I think that we think mostly alike on this.   I'm for the societal normalizaion of homosexuality.   I'm not for the nasty tactics used by some folks who feel that way, including branding anybody who feels otherwise as having a phobia.    And such work against themselves.     But in a Wikipedia sense, such opinions are not relevant.  Two definitions of the word exist, and one of them is sky-is-blue obviously controversial. The problem with the article is that, as a part of a POV quest, it pretends that the more controversial """"all opposition is phobia"""" definition is the ONLY definition. That would be just a difference of opinion but the more severe problem there is the nasty tactics used by a certain cadre there against people who do not agree with their quest.  I think that they have set the record for the amount of bogus tactics and bogus accusations used against a fellow editor.  And when I see people using such tactics against people in Wikipedia to further their purposes, I really see red.

And no I do not think that you are misguided.  I think that the real world you and your thoughts and efforts are right on track and admirable. And in Wikipedia you are a kind and thoughtful editor.  About the worst complaint I could muster is taking real life advocacy a bit too much into Wikipedia and having a bit of a hard time understanding my someone abstract analysis of the structure of the article, which is necessary to present the issues in Wiki-terms.

response to your nasty personal attacks, Blockader and Blah
'You people are unbelievable in your ignorance and the ease to which you get brainwashed by subversive propaganda.
 Learn to read. I said that Paine and Jefferson came up with the ideas for a minarchist government whereby the freedom and equality of the people would  be protected. Have you read Paine and Jefferson? You are attacking the wrong men. If you want to rightfully attack an American forefather attack Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, and others.
 I never said they were anarchists. I do say, though that Jefferson expressed his admiration for anarchism. If he had suggested it at a congressional meeting he probably would have been shot or lynched or they just would have impeached him. (Something that many of them wanted to do anyway.)
 Being patriotic to your country and anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Sounds like you have been reading too much Communist propaganda. Communists just love to subvert governments and China is trying to subvert this one right now. I personally would love to overthrow the fascist-socialist state we're in right now and get back our freedom. But Maoism is not something I would have in mind in the way of freedom.
 Blah and Bockade, since you think you know the ideologies that are best for me, let me find one for you. Hmm, maybe subverting your current government into a dictatorshiptotalitarian state would be appropriate. Or perhaps, as you are incapable of reading comprehension or the most rudimentary thought, working in a convenience store, rather than editing what used to be an encyclopedia would be a good idea for you. Or maybe, how about going and fucking yourself. Now, after having  baited me with your ignorant and idiotic comments, go running to the admins and report me for PAing you, thereby proving beyond any shadow of a doubt how unanarchistic yet socialistic you really are.

Next, let me be clear: Mr. User:Aboutmovies vandalized an article. Then he argued with and ultimately attacked Pcap, the editor who reverted the vandalism. Then Pcap, presumably out of frustration, asked me for help, as I was the one who had provided most of the original text for that article.  I am not active much anymore on wikipedia, so I mostly just I commiserated on Pcap's talk page. I told him I would not get involved. (Why am I not active? Because there are too many assholes like User:Aboutmovies allowed to run free, making life shitty for everyone.)  

Now Mr. User:Aboutmovies, apparently having too much time on his hands, snoops through my personal communications on Pcap's talk page. And so, after putting his nose where it doesn't belong, he gets his nose out of whack, and comes to my personal talk page, and attacks me. Why? This guy clearly owed Pcap an apology. He could have offered an apology. He could have quietly slunk off with his tail between his legs, and repented in private. No, instead of doing the right, honorable thing, he instead chooses to attack me. (So who is escalating? He is.) So I called him an asshole, which he richly deserves. So then he escalates some more: he gets you to block me.  You were sucked right into his game.  You did not bother to do any due diligence. AT ALL. You should have blocked him, not me.  Once you realized your mistake, which Pcap points out to you above, you could have offered me an apology, turned around, and blocked Aboutmovies instead. Did you bother to do any of these things?

Firstly, the FGD for Units 3 and 4 is now complete and operational.

Also there are now plans for a multi fuel CHP plant on the site. http://www.sse.com/Ferrybridge/TheMultiFuelProject/

And a carbon capture pilot scheme is currently under construction, which will capture 1% of the flue gas from Unit 4 (equivalant to 5MW). http://www.sse.com/Ferrybridge/TheCCSProject/

The figure of 218 million litres of CW an hour doesn't really mean anything to me... it's quite a difficult thing to imagine... maybe stating something along the lines that this equates to the 4 CW pumps delivering roughly 60 tonnes of CW every second... or enough to fill an olympic sized swimming pool in under a minute, might help people visualise just how much 218 million litres an hour is.

There is a note stating """"Not to be confused with Eggborough Power Station or Drax Power Station"""" at the beginning of the article, which is fair enough as they all sit in a line within about 15 miles of each other and are easily confused, but there's no similar note on either the Eggborough or Drax articles.

Using your reasoning, we should never be able to oppose on comprehensiveness issues either, because if a consensus of the regular editors of the page says that the article is comprehensive, then it must be. FAC's entire purpose is to try to get a larger perspective on whether the article meets the appropriate policies or guidelines (in other words, consensus can change). I do think that the RCC page suffers sometimes because most of its editors have a very strong POV. That is understandable; people usually work on topics they are passionate about (either for or against). I fully acknowledge (and praise) that they are trying to make the article as NPOV as possible, but when you hold a strong POV sometimes it is hard to recognize where neutral actually is. That is why processes like FAC, GAN, and PR are essential, because then you can get (hopefully) the opinions of people who don't hold a strong POV on the topic. I would encourage you to post at WT:FAC to see what the consensus is for how to review an article - are NPOV and comprehensiveness concerns off-limits?

 This Evolution Thread Is A Perfect Example Of Why No One Ever Takes Wikipedia Seriously 

There is no such process as """"evolution"""". It does not exist. """"Evolution"""" is FICTIONAL. There is no process in which species morph into other species. There is no process in which fish jump out of the ocean, decide they will start breathing air, grow arms and legs and eventually morph into a multitude of various land creatures. """"Evolution"""" can only be described at best as a science fiction spoof, and it is really even too preposterous for that

The simplest way I can get this through your moronic heads

Unicellular organisms DO NOT convert into multicellular organisms. End of story, end of your crock theory 

Forget the fact that there are no """"transitional"""" fossils on Earth, or that it is impossible for a DNA code to spontaneously add or subtract chromosomes (become a different species), or that this asinine process has NEVER happened once in the entire recorded history of biology. Forget the fact that every scientific and biological fact known to man prove that """"evolution"""" does not exist and never could. Or that every single legitimate scientist in the world realizes """"evolution"""" is a farce

""""There is no such thing as evolution."""" ~Albert Einstein

Forget all of that and just get that first fact through your head. Single cell organisms do not convert to multi-celled. You're insane species morphing crock of idiocy is DOA

You can scream and lie and distort and deny fact, but it will not change anything and it will never make this farce come true. It will only make you look like a raging retard

My problem here is that Walsh is not taking any time whatsoever when making his 'reviews'. The result is that he simply VfD tags a page for no other reason than that he does not know anything about the subject. I have no objection to removal of fancruft etc. but these pages would have been VfD in any case by a more careful reviewer who took more than a minute to consider each page.

How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

Frustration with repeated deletions and un-sourced additions by Jrkso

Jrkso,

I would like to think that you are editing in good faith - but you make it hard!  You seem to just pull ideas out of your head, delete well-sourced facts (repeatedly), and replace them with your personal concoctions - sources be damned.

Latest of many examples (for more, see Talk page, above):

You have now decided that the Taliban killed Sitara Achakzai, so you just plopped that into the article in the """"Government and Politics"""" section.  You provide no sources for this """"new discovery"""", no explanation.  You just went for it (adding bolded words, below): 

""""Women in public life in many parts of the country are subject to routine threats and intimidation, according to a December, 2009 report by Human Rights Watch. Several high profile women have been assassinated, but their killers have not been brought to justice. When Sitara Achakzai, an outspoken and courageous human rights defender and politician, was murdered by the Taliban in April 2009, her death was seen as another warning to all women who are active in public life.""""

Do you honestly believe that you are contributing in a worthwhile way to Wikipedia with these methods?  Your seem to be intent not so much on re-writing the article, but on trying to re-write history itself.  No sources, no explanations, no sense.

And it gets worse.  On the edit page, where you again deleted facts, you seem to be explaining a deletion with this comment: 'Danieldis47, such a statement ... a """"transparent election is not possible."""" is POV ... how can that not be possible?)""""  

Man - It's a quote from the candidate himself!  It's HIS explanation for why he quit (not mine!)  That's why it is in quotes!  Would you delete an excerpt from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address on Lincoln's page because it's his point of view (POV?)??

I am entirely frustrated here.   

I suggest we seek third-party mediation.

 Vandalism by 99.44.204.232. Please stop it  

Would 99.44.204.232 stop vandalising this article.  People have invested a lot of time and effort to improve this article  it doesn't help if you keep vandalising it.  In future if you have something positive to add to this article please discuss it in the talk page.  I have to spend hours undoing what you have just done.  Citing several sources (some of which are unreliable) about one particular issue which has already been addressed and sourced with notable sources is one thing, deleting edits with notable sources and then copying and pasting those sources to make a point is another.  You wanted the article to talk about Serer Nile Valley migration.  That had already been discussed several times with notable sources like Gravrand, Cheikh Anta Diop, etc.  You also wanted the ethnonym of Serer to reflect the thesis of Diop.  The article already did that with notable sources including Diop himself.  If only you took the time to read the whole article you would have realised that, all these had been addressed. However, you should also appreciate that not every scholar and certainly not the ultra traditionalist Serer who wants nothing to do with Egypt agree with Diop and in fact his thesis were rebutted by several scholars including Schuh, etc.  These are relevant view points which should also be taken into account in other to avoid bias.  

I will now respond to the """"sources"""" that you have provided.

Link 1: 
http://books.google.com/books?id=EZLF3T-5tlgC&pg;=PA706&lpg;=PA706&dq;=serer+wolof+north+east+africa&source;=bl&ots;=6ZlcoUiSsf&sig;=zOFR1CQY5BWf2thxHjWIhmq9Q8Y&hl;=en&ei;=BMFiToPpH6HL0QGE142OCg&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=6&ved;=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q;&f;=false

Have you realised that this source is not credible contrary to all the sources cited? Have you also realised that the author referred to the Kingdoms of Sine and Saloum as Wolof states?  Even the least verse on Senegambian history can easily find out for themselves that the Kingdom of Sine and Kingdom of Saloum were Serer Kingdoms not Wolof never mind a supposed scholar.   
Further, all the sources, historical and archaeological evidence shows that the Senegambian stone circles were built by the Serer people. (See: Gravrand, Pangool; Gamble, Salmon and Njie; Burke and Else; and F. Richard).

Since they were built by the Serers, and evidence have shown that they are built well before the 14th century, how then could the Serers have migrated into the area into the 14th century?  That doesn’t make sense.  Now the Serers may have migrated to from the Nile Valley as implied by Henri Gravrand in “La Civilisation Sereer, Pangool”, which is one of the sources cited in the article,  but as noted by Gravrand, if they did came from the Nile it was more than 5 thousand years ago and certainly not the 14th century. Further, as demonstrated by Gamble, Salmon and Njie, the Serer are the oldest inhabitants of Senegambia, others later moved in.  This backs up archealogical source, backs up Gravrand, Kleine, Richard  and so on.  
If your source was referring to the Guelwars of Kaabu coming from Kaabu to Sine in the 14th century at least I could understand that because it was at that time the Battle of Turubang (1335) occurred as stated by Sarr, Becker and others.  Even the Wolofs were already present long before the 14th century never mind the Serer people who have been present for thousand of years. Further as substantiated in the article with credible sources which all backs up each other, the Almoravid wars on Takrur due to religion (Islam) led to the Serers of Takrur who were finally defeated in Battle to leave Takrur and headed south.  That was in the 11th century during Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar and War Jabi.  Even those “Takrurien” Serers came south long before the 14th century to join their other Serer relatives (See Daggs).

"Glosbe does translate ezman as “heaven” (******) or “sky” (*****) and it back-translates “heaven” as ezman.

 Some definitions from Merriam-Webster Unabridged:

 Heaven. 1. a. … especially, the expanse [of space] that seems to be over the earth like a great … dome — usually used in plural. 2. a. … the place … of the blessed dead.
 Earth. 1. a.  … soil, ground. 2. the sphere of mortal life comprising the world with its lands and seas as distinguished from spheres of spirit life — compare heaven, hell.
 Sky. 1. b. the expanse [of space] appearing as a great vault … over the earth. 2. heaven (def. 2) — often used in plural.
 Tremble. 1. to shake involuntarily (as with fear, cold, excitement, fatigue).

 These two expressions are good idiomatic English:
 “If his wrath is aroused, the skies will tremble [in fear].”
 “If his wrath is aroused, the heavens will tremble [in fear].”
 Here the singular “sky” and “heaven” would not be used in good spoken English, only in mediocre written English.

 So we have a choice of eight ‘very good’ literal translations:
 “YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] skies tremble.”
 “YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] heavens tremble.”

 If you try speaking them aloud, you may find that this one sounds best:
 A. “YPG goes walking, and the earth and heavens tremble.” Something about the meter (the cadence) just makes it sound liks a military motto.

 The present-progressive clause “YPG is walking” would naturally correlate with the present-progressive clause “the earth and skies are trembling.” But we want to use simple present tense in the second clause.  (See above.)

 To do so, a native English speaker would begin with “YPG goes walking …”, because it combines both tenses: simple present and present progressive.

 But see whether you can come up with a better-sounding combination!",0

Gyan Publishing and circular refs
I'm reinventing the wheel you discovered: WP:RSN#""""Faith & philosophy of Hinduism"""".     talk   
Yikes. Those pseudo sources are back again. I knew I should have started WP:List of Circular References way back then. Just never got around to it (and I had some disagreement from other editors at that time). What do you think, Will? Would this be a good idea? — (talk) 
Another pseudo-source I see used often are some books called something like the """"Webster Book of quotations on Politics"""" (but that's not it), which are issued on a variety of topics. They cite their source as Wikipedia, but they abbreviate it """"WP"""" and many editors don't catch that.  I think there's merit in a central list. It wouldn't fluctuate much - books aren't going to be re-issued to address the problem, though some websites might fix it. The only gray area I see are those sources which cite Wikipedia, where it's possible to exclude the WP-sourced content and still use the other parts. I suppose that a search of the RSN archives and of pages that link to WP:CIRCULAR would find most instances that have been discussed. This problem is only going to get worse as Wikipedia continues to grow and as publishers grow more desperate for profit in a dwindling market.     talk   
I agree. The problem will only get worse and, over time, it becomes more difficult to parse the article histories to determine if/when the article was copied. And rather than search through the growing mountain of archives, it would be nice to be able to quickly direct an editor to a previous discussion  especially in cases like ISHA and Gyan which will obviously pop up again. I think what would work is a page with a table format which lists the title, the publisher, a link to the RSN archived discussion, and a Notes column which discuss those 'gray areas""""  whether the entire source is copied or particular chapters/sections. I'll try to work something up over the weekend and then ask for your input.  — (talk)

Is it UNDO? 
Years later, it's 50% of her OWN self-promoting website. My instincts tell me that loyal fans - that is """"fans"""" as in the root word fanatics, will contact her through her website and pled with her to remove her account of the incident (or see her memory besmirched on Wikipedia! – That’s just humor to make a point, let that knot in your panties loosen up a bit. Come on. Life will go on if a mild accurate account of the arrest is included). JFK had multiple extra marital affairs, people are interested in that fact. In Clinton’s day, people were so interested that he went through impeachment because of his outside-of-marriage-activities. In Mary Ann’s case, it is all the more interesting because it allegedly has been her co-star, Gilligan, supplying her marijuana for years.

BLP: 
No one answers Chowbok’s questions on any of the “reasons” why this information is blocked, that is, “answer” in the sense of saying anything other than rhetoric. WHY MUST THIS INTERESTING EVENT BE EXCLUDED FROM WIKIPEDIA WHEN THE SUBJECT’S OWN WEBSITE DEVOTES SPECIAL ATTENTION TO IT? Because those guarding her memory, unlike her, can’t deal with a least brief mention of the truth? But in that vein, are we as loyal citizens of Gilligan’s Island duty-bound to protect our virgin queen? Grow up. Let the truth be included.

If Mary Ann writes a biography, the excerpts released by the publisher will assuredly include the arrest while in possession of marijuana, and those facts will be the ones that bring attention to her book. The most worn pages of her biography will be the pages discussing the arrest and the aftermath, unless it turns out that she was in a long-running threesome with Mr. Howell and the Skipper. Oh, by the way, why do I refer to her as “Mary Ann?” Because I am being disrespectful; much like the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of you are to Chowbok and anyone else who disagrees with you. No amount of charm or politeness on my part is going to win a single one of you over. You need to rise above the digs and the rhetoric and improve this article because the exclusion of this information of significant interest to the vast majority of people hurts Wikipedia. If you can’t get over sweet Mary Ann getting her adorable little button nose dirty, or you can’t rise above me being disrespectful, you surely won’t elevate yourselves to include the facts simply because it is, editorially, the right decision. 
I
F YOU WANT TO PLAY THE ROLE OF EDITOR, THEN TAKE ON THE BURDEN OF DOING THE JOB WITH THE PRIDE OF MAKING UNBIASED EDITORIAL DECISIONS. If you are simply a Mary Ann worshipper, then join her fan club, bow towards Gilligan’s Island seven times a day, and burn incense before her golden image; but don’t pretend to be an editor with the slightest degree of integrity.

Years later, HER ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT is told only through the words of her lawyer. She refuses to give a personal account. I find that fascinating. Even O.J. spoke personally when he denied murdering his ex-wife. Hell, in his case, he spoke DIRECTLY to the Judge in front of a live TV audience, even though he had four of his lawyers standing right next to him. Mary Ann, on her own website, still hides behind the unsigned words of her lawyer (I highly recommend reading his words. If the presentation/spin upon the events is not hysterical to you, you have not yet developed the critical thinking necessary to be an editor (well, anywhere but on Wikipedia; interestingly, a place I do not have the right to edit the Sacred Page of The Virgin Mary Ann). 
The CONSENSUS is that Mary Ann is MORE WIDELY KNOWN for the arrest while in possession of marijuana than anything else she has ever done. It's not only the top single reason that anyone searches for information on her, variations on arrest/marijuana/drunk driving are the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of the any searches about her.

BE BOLD?: 
“Be Bold” and edit says Wikipedia’s founder. But the bullies on this issue say, if you are “bold,” you will be sent messages to stop editing, and we will block you from editing anything about Mary Ann as her page is “protected.” 

I can go to the Wikipedia page of Wikipedia creator and founder Jimmy Wales and edit anything I chose on his page, but not so Mary Ann. I can even go to the page about that other “Mary” - you might have heard of her, she gave birth to Jesus Christ, Lord and Savior - and edit anything and everything.

What credibility can any editor of Wikipedia have when its founder’s page can be edited, pages of living and revered religious and historical figures can be edited, but editing of a 1960s’ short run ensemble cast sit-com bit player’s page must be reviewed and “approved” by self-proclaimed “editors,” aka B.O.G.I, the Bullies Of Gilligan’s Island.

Comment:
First, Skinsmoke, you need to AGF. I have not been trying to convey a biased picture of the guidelines, as your comment """"very selective"""" seems to suggest. While browsing the page, I may have missed something, and skipped parts that didn't seem to apply at first glance, but if so, it is an honest mistake, and I resent comments suggesting anything else.
Second, the guidelines seem to use the words """"normally"""" and """"often"""" and """"sometimes"""". That doesn't seem very binding.
Third, I don't remember being in a discussion last week where the """"European pattern of disambiguating by comma"""" argument was used. Which one of the supporters above are you referring to? It surely isn't me, because I strongly disagree. This """"City, State"""" naming convention is North American, at least in my world.
On the subject matter, I can't imagine that any Dane in his right mind would refer to the Danish city of Hatting as """"Hatting, Danmark"""". Likewise, I don't think any yodler would refer to the Austrian city of Hatting as """"Hatting, Österreich"""". Ergo: both cities are named Hatting. Also, if you check the da.wiki names for the cities dabbed by the municipality name (in the other RM), you'll see that they're all having the dab in parentheses. So, """"[a]ny specific national convention takes precedence though"""", right? Ergo: the dab should be in parentheses.
In any case, if there really are binding rules to your interpretation, I think they should indeed be changed.

About serb radical nationalist editors

Hi, I’m posting this anonymously because I don’t want to be annoyed with more and more attacks on my talk page (and the head-aching duty to answer each accusation).

Anyway, I’ve been editing Wikipedia from some years on, and it seems like there is a very strong SRS-like Cabal here in this encyclopedia that have been able to put their very distorted vision of Yugoslav history, persons and wars in practically all of the articles related to these themes. It’s disturbing.

If someone read Wikipedia articles related to Yugoslav Wars and base solely on them as a source of research (as many and many students in US and around the world do today), he or she will """"learn"""" that """"the """"Holy Serbs were victims, the USA/NATO/Albanian/Croats/Muslims ere the villains, and a great injustice was made to the innocent Holy Serb population that never made anything wrong in History but to defend themselves from the aggressors"""".

This is gross revisionism of one of the worst atrocities of Europe in the second half of 20th century. It's like to put the blame of the Holocaust on Poland and the Jewish people rather then on Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.

But the most incredible thing is that this radical nationalist vision are winning the game here in Wikipedia. The SRS Cabal editors use extreme pressure, group action and extreme edit techniques (and they're not usually caught on Wikipedia anti-edit war barriers, since they act as a collectivity) they are imposing their vision without constraints. People who try to question them or make any kind of edit that contradicts their rhetoric are hardly harassed in their Talk Pages and the talk Pages of the articles. 

And what is worse of all, thy use the Administration of Wikipedia and the rules of Wikipedia  to achieve their goals.

These people know very well the functioning of the tools of power and management in Wikipedia, and they use this knowledge to pressure, to block, and finally to silent editor who defy the radical nationalist ideology. Like many other authoritarian organizations, they use collective organized pressure to neutralize individual dissenters. And they go unpunished.

I’m saying this because I've been visiting many user pages of people who have been tried to make more balanced articles about Yugoslav matters here in Wikipedia, and when I saw their Talk pages I generally saw infinite hellish arguments with editor from the SRS-like Cabal, many adverts, many blockings… and many editor who simply ceased to edit anymore because all of this.

Sadly, I don't know what to do. I would like very much to find a way to counter-balance these editors, but I don't know how.  I've been thinking like to catch up people who share my visions and found something like a """"Pro-Accuracy Anti-Serb-Radical Group"""", but I don't know how to make this, since if something alike would be created somehow here inside Wikiepdia, it would be shut down in minutes by the SRS-like Cabal trough their well-known techniques.

Do you know any way to solve this Gordian Knot? If you have any ideas, please anwser here. I'll get back to read it. Best Regards.""",0

Trivia is just that, trivia. Its trivial by nature. Just because you think its interesting, doesn't mean its useful. As the onus is on the editor adding material, perhaps we might have a reason for this list to be here. What other films (and I mean good articles) contain such a shopping list of items? What is useful about knowing that a film uses artistic licence and props that aren't the real thing? Is that really so surprising that every one has to be listed.

• On April 24, 1915 the Germans used chlorine gas against the Canadian First Division at the Second Battle of Ypres. With the wind in the German’s favour, anything short of a full retreat would have put the Canadians in the path of the gas. Realizing the only fresh air was at the German line, the Canadians pushed forward, breathing through water- or urine-soaked rags as makeshift gas masks. (It was believed that the ammonia in the urine would neutralize the chlorine.)

• The Canadians held their ground until they were reinforced by British troops a day and a half later. The battle earned the Canadian forces great respect, though it came at a cost of some 6,000 men, and ended in a stalemate.",0

His idea can be seen from the first three (of six) Chapters in his """"Contents"""". In particular in Chapter II.3 he defines his normal algorithm (see sub-section below) in terms of a set of symbols that form words, and a method using substitution rules to create new but valid words.

Although this sounds exactly like a """"recursive language"""" (""""Equivalence of a type 0 grammar to a Turing Machine"""" cf Hopcroft and Ullman p. 221, Introduction to Automata theory, Languages and Computation, Addison-Wesley, 1979) nowhere do Hopcroft and Ullman cite Markov, neither in their index nor in their bibliography.

 Nutshell description of Markov's definition of his """"normal algorithm"""" (pp.63ff) 

In particular, the notion """"2."""" of """"steps of local nature"""" appear also in Blass and Gurevich with regards to Kolmogorov-Uspensky (KU) machines:
Gurevich proposed to Uspensky that """" 'every computation, performing only one restricted local action at a time, can be viewed as (not only  being simulated by, but actually being) the computation of an appropriate KU machine.' Uspensky concurred."""" (Blass, Gurevich 2003, p. 10)

Markov's definition:  

""""1. Separate elementary steps, each of which will be performed according to one of these rules...""""

""""2. ...steps of local nature ..."""" [as opposed to """"integral nature"""" ... he means that the algorithm won't change more than a certain number of symbols to the left or right of the observed word/symbol ]

""""3. Rules for the substitution formulas ...""""
 1) order given is their preferred order of use
 2) apply substitution to the first entry of the left-hand member

""""4. Definite prescription for termination...""""
 1) a means to distinguish a """"concluding substitution""""
 2) """"simple""""

It would be really overdoing things to include convolutions with more input functions in the sandbox article, but I plan a gallery-like page in the info still to be uploaded to gnu.org.
Development of the convolution theme includes other mathematical concepts. Far from being a """"one-trick pony"""" you ought to know that the mathematics of the delta function, alone, lends itself to further visualization of subject matter routinely taught in dsp and related courses. Besides the ability to code, Development only needs imagination.
As the article indicates, I too made the mistake that Fortran was a dinosaur. Fortran is under active development, surpassing the performance of C in certain areas. I also code in C, Lisp, Scheme, and will be writing some code for C-Graph in Python - but modern Fortran remains a good choice for the core code.
There are websites that offer the demonstration of convolution, but none that encompass verification of the convolution theorem with ease, or that offer the range of features GNU C-Graph does. The download statistics verify C-Graph's growing popularity.
The meritless claim of """"online promotion and documentation (marketing?)"""" has been recited elsewhere and is transparent in its intent.
Yes, you did miss the point. I won't comment on the other """"significant"""" additional resources and external links listed in the articles on Convolution and Convolution Theorem, except that they hardly present """"new science"""", which is not a requirement for a reference.
No, it's not possible to deflate my ego. I'm accustomed to these types of responses - and use them as building blocks.

Enough said. The reason more information on C-Graph is not already at GNU is because I find myself having to spend too much time dealing """"blocks"""" in various forms. Wikipedians visiting this talk page have the text for the references should they choose to use them. Happy editing!

We seem to have a few issues under discussion at the same time here, and I think it would be helpful to separate them.   

Maintaining """"old"""" FAs
As  said (00:14, 11 December 2008), this article was promoted to FA in 2006, when standards were less demanding, so work is needing to keep it close to current FA standard.

Unfortunately the """"committee"""" process advocated by  doesn't work if the """"committee"""" is slow to respond. In Oct 2006 I pointed out some serious scientific errors in Dinosaur, another """"old"""" FA; nothing happened so in Jan 2007 I gave notice of my intention to fix these points; a few days later, after nobody objected, I fixed them; and a few days later the corrections were reverted, so that the article again contained the errors I'd pointed out 3 months earlier.    

Quality of images
This one has the potential to run for a long time. I have no strong objections to the image per se, but I'm not sure the article needs a reconstruction of a juvenile T rex'.   

Selection of images
Wikipedia is not a picture gallery, and images need to be used selectively. IMO if we have have plenty of images, as we appear to for dinosaurs, we  should use those that illustrate the content rather than just providing eye-candy. In many cases diagrams should take priority over pure pictures.   

Size and placement of images
There has been recent disussion of this at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#Forcing Lead image (plus a more general Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style item that's now archived and I can't find it) and at Wikipedia talk:Accessibility#Image position. To sum up my own views:
Images that illustrate specific content should be alongside that content.
Layout of pages that use images has become more difficult as widescreen monitors have become more prevalent, as increasing the text width reduces the height of paragraphs, sections, etc.
I dislike left-floating images, as this makes the text less readable by changing the postion of the start of the next line, so that users have to search for it rather than jump to a familiar X co-ordinate.
The functions of images vary. Sometimes they convey a lot of detailed info, and a larger size than the default is needed. On other occasions they need give only a general impression of what something looks like, and a smaller size than the default is adequate. The majority of readers are unregistered and therefore cannot set preferences for image size or anything else. Hence editors have to pick image sizes that are appropriate for the purpose.
Accessibility to users with poor vision (but not functionally blind) is irrelevant, as they will either have their browsers set permanently on """"zoom in"""" or have software that zooms in for all apps.
 makes ugly gaps in the text and reduces the readability of articles.
IMO all these points indicate that MOS cannot dictate a """"one size fits all"""" solution and editors should be free to set image sizes.   """,0

 Mis-quoted text, possibly propaganda? 

""""In 2006, the United Nations mounted a covert operation to capture or kill Joseph Kony. A squad of U.S.-trained Guatemalan Special Ops soldiers set out into Congo's Garamba National Park, a longtime LRA refuge and the scene of the 2008–2009 Garamba offensive. Trained in jungle warfare and accustomed to surviving in the bush for long stretches, the Guatemalans were equipped with M-16s and the latest special-operations technology. Five LRA soldiers were killed and none of the Special Ops soldiers survived. According to one account, the commander of the Special Ops soldiers was beheaded. The battle, which lasted for several hours, included hand to hand combat. Reports put the U.N. dead at eight to forty. The LRA left the corpses in the jungle but took the weapons—including heavy machine guns and grenade launchers.[69]""""

I removed this from the article (someone else saw that this was there, but no one deleted it). The source doesn't say anything about Guatemalan troops, or mention the battle. It's a series of six pictures with stories from individuals who were in some way affected by the LRA, but not even the word """"Guatemalan"""" is present. Much less a description of a battle.

Lord Bute resigned this morning.  His intention was not even suspected till Wednesday, nor at all known a very few days before.

Wednesday would have been the 6th, and that accounts for the few sources that end Bute's term that day.  """"This morning"""" refers to the 8th.

For the avoidance of doubt, these discretionary sanctions apply to any dispute regarding the proper article title, pronoun usage, or other manner of referring to any individual known to be or self-identifying as transgender, including but not limited to Chelsea/Bradley Manning.  Any sanctions imposed should be logged at the Sexology case, not this one.

 I understand your frustration. So, some comments: the shortcuts thing you propose would break down as soon as a demotion or promotion happened.

You might want to check out WP:Nutshell, something I started when I was just getting into this, for a more legal codification.
 Note that there have been efforts before to merge or clean up or take care of policies, or long discussions on what to do with them. I have not seen one so far that has succeeded. I firmly believe that specific tactics should not be discussed. General strategy (""""reduce size, wordcount, statement-count, number, etc. of policies"""") is fine.

""""1. Not to be confused with shoto meaning """"short sword""""; confusion about the derivation of """"Shotokan"""" may occur otherwise. The Kanji for shoto, """"pine waves"""", is (松涛). The first character is (松), which means pine tree. The second character (涛) is a kanji variant of (濤), which means large wave. The Kanji for shoto, short sword, is (小刀). The first character is (小), meaning small, and the second character is (刀), meaning blade. Any literate Japanese reader who saw """"松涛"""" would not mistake it.""""

You say that you do not *agree* with this, but you cannot seem to explain what is *wrong* with it. It would make no claim whatsoever, when posted in the article, to any reasonable person, that the """"short sword"""" story is being told out there (even though it is; I just don't have it in a book for you, so I'm not trying to claim it on Wikipedia). It can be looked at as *preemptively* preventing confusion.

For someone who says he wants to work together, you are laying down a lot of conditions. I think it is reasonable to say at least:

""""1. Not to be confused with shoto meaning """"short sword"""". The Kanji for shoto, """"pine waves"""", is (松涛). The first character is (松), which means pine tree. The second character (涛) is a kanji variant of (濤), which means large wave. The Kanji for shoto, short sword, is (小刀). The first character is (小), meaning small, and the second character is (刀), meaning blade. Any literate Japanese reader who saw """"松涛"""" would not mistake it.""""

I think it's reasonable of me to dispute not showing the Kanji and it's reasonable of me to dispute not having that first sentence that basically says """"Note that this use of shotodoes not mean """"short sword""""."""" If you want to put in that sentence rather than """"Not to be confused with..."""" that would be fine with me.  08:32""",0

 OneGuy's vanadalism of the discussion page 
Aside from OneGuy deleting other user's comments, he has now begun to blatently disorganize and effectively vanadalize people's comments: he distrupting the flow of users' comments by arbitrarily cutting off paragraphs and inserting his comments in between, instead of being civil and adding his reply to the end of a given post. Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again. OneGuy must be ejected from this discussion before it can have any hope of being a civiled and productive debate. I am left with no choice but to completely resign from this discussion, since it seems that no one is going to be moderating OneGuy's behaviour anytime soon.  Pename

What's ironic is that OneGuy claims he is not a muslim and therefore can not be considered an Islamic apologist!  In fact, most of the Muhammad/Islam apologists here claim to not be Muslim!  Looks like Muhammad's best friends are the infidels.  

As of moderating OneGuy's behavior, the Arbitrators are looking into him and myself after he filed a hypocritical arbitration request against me and I thus filed a countercomplaint against OneGuy.  Whenever OneGuy spots someone who doesn't agree with his radical apologistic viewpoint he tries to silence them by any means at his disposal.  OneGuy, in his complaint in arbitration, accused me of rivert(sic) wars and having POV in my contributions yet he does the exact same thing, only more so.  In the arbitration complaint, the arbitrators don't seem as concerned about the POV contributions as they do about personal attacks, revert wars and my vandalism of his user page. See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34.  When OneGuy was giving evidence against me he incorrectly called a few minor word changes as a revert war (even though the change were only made once or twice) and he clearly left out the revert wars in which he was involved (but the arbitrators were not fooled - they found him out).

Since the arbitrators will probably not do anything about his radical apologistic contributions, they will most likely respond to his vandalism of the talk pages.  Feel free to post your complaints regarding OneGuy on Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34/Evidence.    06:56, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 Since when replying on talk page has become vandalism? Only one time I deleted Pename comments when he cut and pasted his comments that were already on the page on top of my response in a new section that I created (""""death to critics""""). Pename has ignored what we are discussing and is resorting to personal insults and false accusations (in violation of wiki policy) that I vandalized the talk page. He now claims that he did not copy the verse from anti-Islamic site. If true, where did he find the interpretation that 8:67 means kill prisoners of war? He implied that interpretation in the article. At worst, the verse condemns the behavior of taking prisoners in order to make money, but he has not given his source that says 8:67 means kill prisoners. Instead of answering where he found that interpretation (if not anti-Islamic site), Pename is resorting to personal insults and outright lies that I vandalized the talk page  18:46, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 IMPORTANT: There is currently a proposal to change the design of some of our projects navigational templates. Please weigh in here. This project wide change needs as many opinions as possible to determine consensus.

 Always use an edit summary even when the edit is minor so that other users know why you are adding or removing information; we can't read minds.

 With 's recent tagging spree, there are now over 2,500 articles associated with the project. If you see Eurovision related articles without the  template on the article's talk page, please add it. You can also read Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment if you would like to help assess articles as well.

Welcome to the ninth edition of the WikiProject Eurovision Newsletter! 

We're less than a month away from the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 and now is the time to make sure that all articles are the best that they can be. This is our busiest time and thousands of people will come to Wikipedia and will see our work. We need to show them that Wikipedia is a place to come for facts and a site that they can rely on.

I can't emphasize enough how important it is for members to take part in discussions on talk pages. We have 65 members and usually less than five people step up and comment. Editing Wikipedia means is being part of a community. Take pride in what you do here and make your positions known!

I hope to see you all editing like a storm next month, and don't forget to submit news for the next newsletter here.

Happy editing,  . Page Milestones

With bubble memory you can't change a one into a zero like you can change a zero to a one  the former requires special processing, the latter does not  and that special processing is several times more time consuming than B or C.  It's such an exceptionally slow process with high overhead, that your perception of your SSD would probably be unfavorable if the manufacturer allowed you to perform it on small chunks of data.

Hi Malaka,

I'm new to Wikipedia (greek-Canadian) and have noticed a strong anti-Greek bias on several articles related to Macedonia. I've been having issues with both Furper and Beam... who seem to be admins that heavily favour FYROM. I've officially complained on the notice board about their threats to block, edit behavior and unusually close relationships with obvious FYROM POV members of Wikipedia.  (specifically Balkanfever) 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#This_anon_.28apparently_User:Crossthets.29.2C_is_an_apparent_POV_Pusher.2C_evidence_below

This is a difficult battle because I am alone at the moment, I am a newbie, and as I said to one of the admins on notice board... I feel like someone reporting a bad cop at a policeman's ball.  However, I still plan to follow up soon with a precise listing of what I perceive as non-NPOV behavior. I noticed while researching this issue you've also have problems with them. Would it be possible to list any problems on your talk page here so I can add them to my report to show I am not alone? Furthermore... since you have been around longer you probably know more Greeks than me around here. Would it be possible to also contact them to ask them if they've also had problems with those two... and (if so) add those incidents to your list?  (and perhaps get them to contact others?) 

Where one person could be bullied with threats of blocking... the concerns of many will be taken much more seriously. I will check back here in a couple of days. Have courage. Regards 209.161.238.86",0

"""I'd like to help! What is the method to detirmine that archival footage is """"authentic""""? Looks real to me and, if you watch Kellerman and Greer in the Zapruder film, which the US Government accepted as authentic, you can clearly see both of these individuals abandoning JFK. Kellerman was specifically assigned as his body guard and was required to shield JFK with his body. Johnson's SS agend did when the shooting started. Instead, Kellerman saw JFK was hit and then simply turned back around and sat there. Greer turned back TWICE as everyone in the limo was visibly in distress. His second turn sure looks unusual for someone who is trained to keep both hands on the wheel! To me it looks like the Adams / Newcomb / Cooper / Robertson observations are correct and the stabilized Zapruder showing Greer turning back to fire a pistol (low near his lap and NOT near Kellerman's forehead) is the evidence hiding in plain sight. Could the shooters have been blowing it and was Greer forced to finish the job?

 A hit list for Jews 
There is a site called Jew Watch out there (I'll let you find the link) which specialises in """"keeping an eye on Jewish activities"""".  It is used as a reference site by anti-semites the world around.  Jew Watch makes it a point to make sure that they do not, under any circumstances, list someone who they cannot confirm 100% is Jewish.  Stormfront, a white supremist web forum, uses Jew Watch all of the time.

The criteria for inclusion on List of British Jews is the same criteria used by Jew Watch.  It is a criteria designed for anti-semites.  It is a criteria that is aimed in hurting Jews.

Jewish communities do not have such a criteria.  They allow anyone to be considered to be a Jew if they have any linkage with the Jewish community, through race, religion or culture.  This is the normal criteria that is used.  If your father is Jewish, then per Jewish community standards, you are Jewish.  And so forth.

Wikipedia as a whole has certain criteria for verifiability.  But these criteria are not being applied to this list.  This is being changed purely because this is a Jewish list.  Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists, this is plainly not true.  If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews, then this list shouldn't exist at all.  And we should especially not try to focus on who are the """"real Jews"""".  Wikipedia are changing their rules, purely to push an anti-semetic point of view.  And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo-nazis, and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community, she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred.  And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers, who have written vehement anti-semetic text throughout Wikipedia.  Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists.  Slim Virgin is an anti-semite.

Right now, I would encourage deletion of this list.  It is being run by anti-semites and used to harm all Jewish people.  Until such time as Slim Virgin can be banned from editing this and related pages, it is dangerous to continue to have such a page.  It is encouraging hatred of Jews.""",1

Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. nableezy - """,1
"Remake?
I can find nothing to support the statement that the 1994 film was in any way, shape, or form a remake of the 1956 film. They shared the same title but otherwise had very little in common. If the 1994 film was indeed a remake, this article (among many other things) will require a citation indicating this.

 The Cause for Invasion
""""The goal was to remake the political landscape—to drive out the Palestine Liberation Organization and install a right-wing Christian Lebanese leader prepared to sign a peace deal with Israel. But Operation Peace for Galilee ended in failure."""" 

""""Israel launched operation """"Peace for Galilee"""" and invaded Lebanon in 1982 in what was sold to the Israeli public as a bid to drive the Palestine Liberation Organization back from the northern border. Sharon went on to drive the PLO out of Lebanon and to try to install a more friendly regime there. ... The Israelis stayed, and their effort to install a new regime ended in disaster."""" 

 The Invasion was planned
""""When, in early June 1982, terrorists of the Abu Nidal organization, a PLO splinter group, badly wounded the Israeli ambassador in London during an assassination attempt, Israel seized the pretext for launching its long-planned offensive."""" 

 The Invasion was opposed by the US and the UN:
 See """"U.N. Security Council Resolution 509""""
""""On June 6, President Reagan, in France to meet with the G-7 Heads of Government at the Versailles Economic Summit, dispatched Habib to Israel to try to restore the cease-fire. That same day the United States joined a unanimous U.N. Security Council Resolution demanding that Israel withdraw from Lebanon and that the border cease-fire be observed by all parties.""""

""""Two Israeli paratroopers tell correspondent Michael Gerti: On Thursday evening, as darkness fell, Palestinian women from Shatila arrived at the post and hysterically told us that the Phalangists were shooting their children and putting the men in trucks. I reported this to my commander, but all he said was: 'It is okay, do not worry.' My order was to tell the women to go back home. However, many women, and entire families as well, ran away from the camps to the north. I went back and repeated my report over and over. Each time, however, the answer was the same: """"It is okay.""""...It was possible to stop the massacre in Shatila, even on Thursday; had they acted on what we reported to our commander.

Hello, especially Haiduc. The material removed here  was done so partially on the pretext of the claimed existence of a slur.  

Men in pederastic relationships are accused of being necessarily materialistic and manipulative. The claim is that the older partner's interest in the younger is always purely for sexual gratification, and that beneath a guise of caring or loving, and a veneer of acceptability of endowing the younger partner with """"choice"""", these relationships are universally damaging to the youth because they are based on mutual deception. The attention given by the older to the younger is assailed as fundamentally self-interested, and the claim is made that the youths are discarded once past the age of attraction.

 Physical sports, Mind sports, Miscellanea, Other

combine Miscellaneous and Other, somehow
move Animal, Athletic, Endurance, Miscellaneous/Other into physical sports (somehow).

Well, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:

In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. 

[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, """"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."""" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” 

Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. 

In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  

Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. 

If you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? 

I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? 

Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2",1

So we're back at the point we were before - is there something special about the relationship between Hagos and Biasutti that allows this transfer of expertise just by citation? My point is that it takes years of training, experience and recognition by others in the field to be considered an expert in that field. You seem to be saying Hagos got it just by citing Biasutti. If David Attenborough cited Niels Bohr would he become an expert in Physics? No he wouldn't, he'd just be an expert in biology who happened to cite an expert in physics once - we wouldn't be able to accept anything he said about quantum mechanics or block holes as fact until we checked it with a genuine expert in the field. So what makes you think Hagos has become an expert in human skin colour just by citing Biasutti? And remember that the policy doesn't just state """"expert"""",  it states """"established expert in the topic whose previous work in the field has been published by reliable third-party publications"""" - unless you are you going to argue that Hagos got Biasutti's reputation and previous publications as well I think this is a dead end argument. You should accept that Hagos doesn't meet the criteria laid down by the WP policy for the creators of self-published sources.
If you don't think that Hagos chose the colours for each country then who do you think did it? They didn't just magically change due to """"migration trends"""" - somebody made a decision that colour X goes in country Y. From the evidence we have it would appear that Hagos was the one who made that decision - it certainly wasn't made by Biasutti or the writers of the national census data that he cites as his sources.
It makes no difference to the situation so I won't argue it, but for the record I don't accept that Hagos is a recognised expert on migration.

 Midway = turning point 

In my view, if there WAS a turning point in the war on Japan, Midway has to be it. While the Japanese had been stopped at Coral Sea, they still had the initiative; they could still choose where and when to attack, and the allies had to react. But not after Midway! It was, after all, THEY that launched the Midway/Aleutians operation, and THEY that were then rocked back on their heels, and THEY that fled afterward. It was THEY that had lost 2/3 of their big, fast carriers (and the carrier was to the War in the Pacific what the ballistic missile was to the Cold War. Somewhere above someone argues that the remainder of the Japanese fleet was still a formidable force, but that is nonsense; all that force could do would be to sail out and get sunk by a carrier-equipped US NAvy)). Far from being """"merely"""" a tactical victory, it changed the whole complexion of the war. 

Now, while they DID attempt some more offensive action (notably by trying to take Port Moresby, again, this time over land via the Kokoda Trail in the 2nd half of 1942), this was all relatively minor, designed to strengthen their DEFENSIVE positions not to conquer, and was  ultimately almost all unsuccessful. They never again tried the kind of massive, seaborne, combined arms operation that had swept them across most of the Pacific in a just a few months. Then just 2 months after Midway the US landed on Guadalcanal, and clearly the initiative was ours, and Japan was in defensive mode. Thus the Guadalcanal campaign can't be considered the actual turning point either - by then the US was clearly on the attack.

I don't think the argument that there is no turning point because Japan could never have ultimately 'won' the Pacific war works out either. Japanese planners DID know that they could not win a long war MILITARILY but that was not their plan. Strategically their plans went something like: 

1. Start the war from as superior a position as possible (hence Pearl Harbor)
2. Race across the Pacific, seizing resources and territory BEFORE the US could gear up for war.
3. Attain as defensible a position as possible (Hence the Kokoda Trail offensive and takeover of the Solomons) and DIG IN.
4. Let the US grind itself down against near impregnable fortresses. 
5.Win a favorable peace settlement when the US tires itself out throwing itself against their defenses.

But they failed at (1) when they didn't sink the US carriers at Pearl Harbor, and only 6 months later Midway signalled the early end of (2). By the failure to take Port Moresby, they also failed at part of (3). They had some hope to succeed at (5); when the bloody costs of both Tarawa and Buna-Gona became known, US public opinion was shaken. Even as late as 1945, many americans found the though of the casualties invading Japan would cost to be appalling.

So, MY conclusion is that Midway WAS *the* turning point in the Pacific. I realize this whole idea of a turning point is rather subjective, but I really think if there was one in the South Pacific, it has to be Midway.

If you look at template:cite book you can see the parameters for a template that defines a cited book.  I always use this template (or others like template:cite journal or template:cite web) because they automatically put the different bits of information into the right format.  template:sfn gives a way to easily make a reference and footnote that link to the cited source, thus:

Displays as:

The trick here is that the """"cite book"""" template includes """"|ref=harv"""" which tells the template to make a footnote from the author's last name and the year of the book, e.g. """"Smith 2009"""", and link it to the book definition.  That may not always be possible, because the author's name and/or publication year may be unknown, in which case you can tell the template what name to use for the footnote, as in  |ref={{harvid|Norwegian Blue}}

Thanks.  I'm not really that into the crises.  Bishonen and I approach Wikipedia very differently, and we can never understand why the other one doesn't get involved in Crisis X or Y that is so clearly all-important.  I care about policy.  I figure that the principle of the thing is extremely important, and if we get good policies and stick to them until it hurts (and then change them when enough people feel the pain, but only with consideration of the pains we feel and the ones we want to avoid), all will be well.  I think Bishonen cares about people, and particularly people getting stomped on by the bullies of the site.  She helps people.

"The explanation that this map can illustrate the views of Venizelos or any other Greek makes no sense to me. You can illustrate his views making a map which shows proposed Greek borders according Venizelos' claims at different time. The demographic maps should be supported with at least some evidence and there is no evidence that the Greeks were such as majority in Thrace as shown in that particular map. I have pointed sources according to the census in Eastern Rumelia, according to Erickson and suggested to search for the election of the first Ottoman national assembly of 1908. 
That is as if let's say that Bulgaria currently claims that 2,000,000 Greeks in northern Greeks are Bulgarians. Does it mean that in the demographic article of Greece we should also include a map which shows those people as Bulgarians in order to illustrate the Bulgarian view? That would make no sense since according to the census those people say they are Greeks. (That is just example, a ridiculous one) 
So if you want to illustrate Greek position make a map showing Greece in its proposed borders but do not use maps which are obviously wrong as that particular one. I repeat, the other demographic maps are also disputable but at least can be supported with some evidence.",0

I have posted on the talk page facts.

And I know wilki does not care about someone personal criminal history.

Calling facts personal attacks.

But I tried to reason with this person who uses wilki to promote and excuse dog fighting as a test.. I asked for references in English and none can be provided.

I provided a New York Times reference and that is removed because it proves it is a blood sport running amock in Russia excused as a test.

I do not make a living off a breeding dogs . But I wish to protect the breed from breed specific legislation. This wrong missleading information posted here does REAL life harm to the breed.

The Russian have created as per more ref a new fighting breed.

Please if you insist on working with this editor while I spend time rescueing all the dogs she forgets in shelters. I cant do all the rescues and stay here fulltime, and care for my farm and dogs. 

So pls i beg youn change the name from CAS to CAO and have her ruin the breed under its russian version name . Allow me to try to save the breed from future bsl.

Maybe if a non competive type person posts , maybe then this would be settled.
So I will contact the writer of link that is being hidden from all , cause it proves the information about the 'test"""" is false.

 How about an RFC then? 

Can we try an RFC?

The neutral question would be """"Should the title of this article be Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia, or Serbia under German Occupation, or something else; consider the prior talk sections above.""""  I will not be making a statement myself, but I may respond after two days, or sooner if others decide not to respect the proposal.  OK?    
No. An RFC while there's an RM going on? Just list the RM on various noticeboards. And an RfC for what exactly? If someone wants to move the article - let him post an RM, that's what its for. We'd probably go through the whole annoying song and dance to no effect. And where's the sense in having an RM for a move to one title, while posting an RfC (of all things) for a move to another title??

I'm sure Antidiskriminator & Co. will jump at this, since for them whatever you (their perceived new-found ally )) propose and I oppose must be a good thing. But it makes no sense. I certainly won't accept any title that has not been agreed-upon in a proper RM, whatever the outcome of the RfC - indeed, if any. Additionally, an RfC may not be the most useful and effective means of DR here, since the dispute is immensely complex, obscure, and thoroughly bogged-down in misleading rhetorical nonsense.

"Technically you still can't distinguish acceleration from gravity - they are, in fact, one in the same. The simple direction difference between the negative and positive masses accelerations are not qualifiers for discrimination. There is no way, in a single reference frame, to distinguish the negative and positive masses - i.e. whether the earth is negative or positive mass and the object in question  is positive or negative. Further, the magnitude of the acceleration should be identical for each object.

I would suggest reading up on Hawking's idea (in his universe in a nutshell book) that mass energy + gravitational energy = 0. In essence, you can create all the matter you want, as long as it has gravitational pull which he regards as a negative energy. If this is the case, then there could, in fact, be negative mass with positive gravitational energy, which behaves in an opposite manner. I would presume that annihilation due to matter-antimatter interactions would have gravitational energy considerations as well - but in any case, the mere fact that negative mass would accelerate in a different direction in a gravitational field does not in itself preclude its existence, especially since gravitational laws were formulated without accounting for this eventuality.",0

 False inormation in the article 
As you would expect, the propagandists would say and do everything to mislead us. They once again proved themselfs to be the proven LIARS we alreayd knew they were since the article wrongly states that the darker picture with the """"fall-off"""" effects is the edited one, which is pure BS.

The original photo is the one with the """"fall-off"""" effect which was printed in The West Australian already back in august 2, 1969 (~6 min in this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMuTiziCszU) while the lighten up picture is the EDITED version who came out much later. So unless the propaganda trolls cant find a version of THEIR claimed original version dated EARLIER than august second 1969, i suggest them to SHUTUP.

Youtube is not a reliable source for information about a conspiracy theory. Is there a reliable source available that supports your claim?   

 The Buzz Alrdin photo is explained at Examination_of_Apollo_Moon_photographs#Issues with crosshairs in photos.   You talkin' to me? 

The video shows a guy holding up the actual newspaper from 2 aug 1969 to prove that the """"fall-off"""" picture is how the original one looked like, but then its youtube who isnt a reliable source!?  your desperate try for making a point is laughable... but i wouldnt expect more from a propaganda TROLL.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 91.145.38.53   

 No, that newspaper doesn't show what the original one looks like.  The original is a transparency that is in NASA's vaults.  They made prints that were widely reprinted. See this for more information.  You talkin' to me? 

Bullshit! excuses from NASA wont make it true! you have the history of that picture in the video i linked to and even the NASA site you linked to shows the fact that the darker picture is the first one, the original from 1969, while the more lighten edited version came out 1975. So why you arguing? you dont have a chance here. As i said, BRING UP a picture dated earlier than 2 aug 1969 or SHUTUP - its that simple!

91.145.38.53, please stop insulting other editors and please sign your posts, just put four tildes at the end .   

I dont tolerating having my talk session closed, this is what the propagandists do? censoring their opponents!
Unless the propagandists cant bring up the picture THEY claim to be the original together with a date which needs to be earlier than second of august 1969, i will change the article. False misleading information should never be tolerated! Its already proven that the """"fall-off"""" darker version IS the original. If anyone wants to argue, then bring up! 91.145.38.53  

 The propaganda liars 
This article is beyond laughable! Since the propagandists trash talking and like to """"debunk"""" ppl like Bart Sibrel, Ralph Rene, and Bill Kaysing (with no evidence to debunk them, however) we should debunk the LIARS the propagandists listen to!  """"youtube is not a reliable source"""" the propagandists says... still they link to youtube videos themselfs to suit their false propaganda in a desperate act to try prove THEIR laughable points. So if they can link to youtube videos, i will do the same just to prove that THEIR sources are nothing else than FALSE PROPAGANDA. Using proven liars like Jay Windley, Phil Plait, and Svectors youtube series as some kinda evidence is laughable.

"""== OldLady Productions ==

History 

OldLady Productions was created in 2007, by their first 2 actors Ryan and Marco. They created OldLady Productions after their first video """" Soccer Battle 2 """".
OldLady Productions then went up to a cast of 5 people. About a year later OldLady Productions fired to of their members ( Daniel and Steven ) and got to new actors ( Marino and Gianni ).
Their most viewed video on youtube was their """" Camp Rock Parody """" video with over 125 000 views after 3 months that it was uploaded. This was a big break for them because 
they never imagined getting anywhere close to that amount of views. Although in reality it is not that many views, for a new video company it was fantastic.

Videos 

We do not know that exact amount of videos that OldLady Productions has due to the fast that they are still under construction. Here are a list of videos we are sure they have released 

- Soccer Battle 2
- Play by the Rules
- American Idiot
- The Prisoner
- Hero Movie
- THE FIGHT OF A LIFETIME ! ! ! ! !
- Ryan V.S Marco
- Nothing
- Fashion Show 08
- Ryan V.S Marco ( part 2 )
- Effects of Bullying
- What happens when you don't play fair !
- The Amazing Jog of 2008
- Detective Movie
- Camp Rock
- How to be a bro !
- Music Battle 2008
- Never Back Down ( training video ) * Parody *
- Chriss Angel
- James Bond

These movies were done for amusement purposes, before OldLady Productions commenced their actual company videos. OldLady productions is planning to create and unveil new and improved movies, starting with * Soccer Battle 3 * You may only be able to see all these videos on the official OldLady productions website. Most of these videos will not be on youtube because they are starting their big outbreak with Soccer Battle 3.

Bonus Videos 

OldLady Productions has also made some bonus videos. Some just being announcement and others behind the scenes. Here is a short list of those videos 

- Soccer Battle 3 ( Production Progress ) = trailer

Advice
I would be interested in getting your views on the role of Tyrenius as a mediator on the Michael Ignatieff talk page. Does he have any status as a mediator?  By that, I mean, do the participants on the page accept him as a mediator or is he self appointed. (I'm mindful both these conditions could apply). How effective has he been in a mediation role?  What problems have arisen, if any?  

The reason I ask is that (as you will have seen) he made a preemptory removal of some text from the page. This is something that is generally frowned on in my experience. His response to my quoting the guideline on the subject was to remove that too. In the words of the guideline, this is """"unacceptable.""""

You have now cited only one source (albeit only in the edit summary)  The New York Times. Apparently, however, you are unaware of the close personal relationship between Lindbergh and the author of that paper's stories, Times' aviation writer Lauren """"Deac"""" Lyman, which went back to 1927 when Lyman befriended a then unknown Lindbergh. Lyman was the only member of the press whom Lindbergh told about his decision to go into self exile in Europe, and he did so because he knew that Lyman would paint this actions in terms most favorable to his friend and, with Lindbergh deliberately """"unavailable at sea"""" for more than a week, that this """"spin"""" would initially be repeated by other papers that would pick up the NYT story from that paper's news service. This relationship and the tone of the resulting early accounts based on are addressed in detail in the cited TIME Magazine article on the issue of press coverage published on January 6th. (""""Since Colonel Lindbergh had offered no public explanation of his departure, and radiograms sent to him on the American Importer were returned with the notation """"Addressee not aboard,"""" the Times' story remained the scripture on which the week's exegesis was built. It was written by bespectacled Lauren D. (""""Deac"""") Lyman, who as the Times' aviation editor befriended obscure young Aviator Lindbergh before his flight to Paris in 1927. Throughout the week Reporter Lyman stoutly refused to reveal the source of his scoop. But Colonel Lindbergh's hatred of certain sensational newspapers, and his corresponding affection for the courteous Times, have long been well-known. ... In keeping with the Times' policy of protecting Hero Lindbergh's privacy, Reporter Lyman weakened his otherwise first-rate scoop by failing to disclose the time and place of the Lindberghs' sailing, their ship's name, their exact destination."""") As Lindbergh's real intentions became known  his intention to live in exile in Europe  it then became clear that this was not just a vacation abroad but that Lindbergh had """"fled"""" the country to protect them from danger that he felt that he and his family were being exposed to in the United States and that he would be living in Europe indefinitely.

Aside from the Times, you have again failed to provide any  citations or sources that support your claim that """"the number of sources which use the neutral """"left"""" is huge compared with the single source for """"fleeing""""."""" (You also have also again misrepresented the number of sources that I have provided which is FOUR, not one.) You have also claimed that I apparently believe that """"flight"""" and """"sailed"""" are the identical word to """"fleeing"""" when I have made no such claim. Sailed only describes the mode of transportation he used (a ship), nothing more. (The word I was emphasizing with """"sailed"""" was """"furtively"""".)

Similarity to """"Boy Kings""""
Section on similarity between this book and The Boy Kings was deleted. The facts in question are easily verified. What was the reason for this deletion?
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

Re: the two flags: on notability, the book has received substantial media attention. See, for example, http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323342404579081503189753492.html

In addition, the author himself is critically acclaimed (see his page).

On sources, Amazon is a credible source for the topic in question, the relative contents of two books. The Twitter sources are necessary given that 1. Twitter is the topic being discussed (specifically: discussions on Twitter about the book), and 2. the issue is new and has not yet been written about in mainstream publications. These sources can be improved as additional information and media coverage becomes available which is likely given the high profile of the author, the ongoing media attention to the book, and the fact that The Circle will soon be released.
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

If it's easily verified, it shouldn't be hard to find secondary sources to support it.   

Agreed, that is a fair point, though it will only be easy to do so if sufficient time has passed for secondary sources to pick up on it which they haven't yet. It was only a matter of hours ago that the alleged victim of plagiarism was made aware of the details of the book in question (The Circle) and therefore able to point out the similarities. In the coming days it is likely to receive more attention. The female author in question has upward of 1,500 Twitter followers and a well-received book on Amazon and the other comments on Twitter corroborating her interpretation also come from prominent Tweeters. While I am a Wikipedia novice, it does not seem that this is an unusually suspect story to report in somewhat-real-time versus other pages that are rapidly updated, and to reiterate, it is very obvious from reading the respective Amazon pages that there are myriad similarities between the books and it is only a matter of time before this is picked up.
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

Update: a secondary source is now available. Updating accordingly. 
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

I see your edit was removed by a bot. I don't think it's impossible that there might surface secondary sources to support this part of the article, but these aren't them. Tweets are generally considered unsuitable, which is why bots remove them. And that Medium post isn't a suitable source either. 1) it's written by the person who is theoretically the aggrieved party in this case, 2) Medium is basically a self-publishing platform, like Livejournal, and doesn't really qualify as a secondary source, especially in the case of a potentially contentious allegation like this.   

Let's not let this plagiarism flap stand in the way of making this a better article.  It could use a lot of improvement.  My personal opinion is that the plagiarism claim (which amounts to """"I wrote a book about a woman hired by a social networking firm, and any similar books are plagiarism"""") should not be included in the article anyway, in the absence of a lawsuit or settlement.  So let's get some interesting stuff about the book in there.  For one thing, Margaret Atwood reviewed the book at length. 70.114.146.227  Eric""",0

*  *  *

I look at a lot of articles (such as BillCJ and many others and it reminds me of books that were published in the 1950 - lots and lots of facts boring, dull uninteresting pictures - picture with no history surrounding what is being published.  In the 1980-90's, a lot of True Aviation historians (i.e. Roger Freeman, Jeff Ethell, Warbirds Worldwide, etc..) found that aviation historians wanted and needed history recorded.  The captions of their books detailed who, what, when, where, etc...  As we progressed into the 2000's, I am finding that today’s writers unfortunately, want to dumb down the article - instead of giving all the details to allow the readers to decide how much level of detail he wants - Again, unfortunately, BillCJ (as well as others) want to take the Dick & Jane approach to aviation history.

This is suppose to be an online reference/encyclopedia - often when you Google an item, the wiki article is the first reference to pop-up so this will be (unfortunately) the first and only reference many will have for a subject.  A subject has to include everyone that references and item, whether it be a 4 year old doing his first model airplane, the aviation historian, the F-16 Buff.  These articles are also used by serious models who want the details.

Articles only tell part of the story - you need the pictures to compliment and point out what the article is discussing.  In the same vein, the pictures need the same level of detailed study (if possible) and care that is place in creating the entire article.  Having a great and fantastic article (such as the F-16) with kindergarten captions makes the entire article pointless.

It is also unfortunate that other editors like Askari Mark feels that detailed captions are meaningless to most readers - again, you can not have an online reference/encyclopedia without filling crossing the t and doting the i's.  Without detailed captions, it like having no reference section - sure you can print captions that state """" Gee an F-16 in Flight """" - especially when it is clear that the airplane is sitting on the ground.  Or the case of one article """"Aircraft is on a bomb-run"""" when it was clear from the picture that the bomb-bay doors were closed, no guns in the waist position and the detailed history showed the aircraft actually was a trainer and never left the United State...

BillCJ also mentioned """" are you seriously suggesting that """" serious historians """" only read WP articles for the pictures? """" - it is a proven fact that 90% of all information processed by humans come from Visual"""" data (i.e. pictures, etc...) - this is the reason Picture books are popular with preschoolers.  The first thing a majority humans look out when reading any thing is the pictures - if the pictures are interesting then many people will stop and read.  If an aviation historian comes across an article that details the subject matter then he will stop and read the contents.

It is also been said that this article is not for the F-16 Buffs - if this is the case, then 
 why have technical specifications
 why have details on each variation??  
 Why have the nuts and bolts of each individual user??
 Etc, Etc, Etc...
Why have detailed information regarding anything regarding the aircraft if this subject is not going to reach out to those who can say yes, this is true (i.e. the historian/buff) - If you are going to have the nuts and bolts in the article then you have to carry this same thought patterns over to have the nuts and bolts details in the photo captions.... (for example: B-52 Specifications, B-52 Costs, B-52 Variants) etc...  this type of informations IS for the Aviation Historian / Buff and generally not for the casual reader (which is MY point in having detailed captions).

If we dumbdown the photocaptions for the """"causual reader, then this level of details Specifications, costs, variations also needs to be removed as it will only confuse the """" casual reader """" and will lead to people calling all such information """" gobbledy-gook """".

If we dumbdown the photocaptions or call detailed information """" gobbledy-gook to most readers """" then terms such as: Wing area, Airfoil, Zero-lift drag coefficient, Drag area, Aspect ratio, Maximum speed:, Combat radius:, Ferry range, Service ceiling ,Rate of climb, Wing loading, Thrust/weight, Lift-to-drag ratio are """"gobbledy-gook to most non-aviation readers""""

BillCJ has also mentioned that Wiki is not the place for F-16 Buff's to write article - This is complete opposite what the founders of wiki wanted when this project (wikipedia as a whole) dreamed many, many years ago - Wiki w",0

""":Kleene (re his (1952) Introduction to Metamathematics) would disagree that metamathematics isn't a topic for mathematics. But Minsky (1967) seems to agree with you, never mind he's not too convincing with his """"intuitive argument"""" using appeals to """"intuitive arguments"""". In his discussion of """"an effective procedure a.k.a. algorithm"""" (his definition, in fact) he says the matter is subjective:
""""Different people may not agree on whether a certain procedure should be called effective. Perhaps there are processes, we might suppose, which simply cannot be described in any formal language, but which can nevertheless be carried out, e.g., by minds. One might even argue that those important, but still mysterious, functions which make minds superior to all presently known mechanical processes must, by their intuitive nature, escape any systematic description.

""""Turing discusses some of these issues in his brilliant article, 'Computing Machines and Intelligence' [1950] .. they amount, in my view, to a satisfactory refutation of many such objections."""" (p. 107)

Minsky goes on to state:
""""One cannot expect to prove Turing's [his name for the Church-Turing] thesis, since the term 'naturally' relates rather to human dispositions than to any precisely defined quality of a process. Support must come from intuitive arguments..."""" (p.108)

Boolos and Jeffrey (1974, 1999) are more constructive:
""""Although this thesis ('Church's thesis') is unprovable, it is refutable, if false. For if it is false, there will be some function which is computable in the intuitive sense, but not in our sense. To show that such a function is computable in the intuitive sense, it would be sufficient to give instructions for computing its values for all (arbitrary) arguments, and to see that these instructions are indeed effective....To show that such a function is not computable in our sense, one would have to survey all possible Turing machines and verify (by giving a suitable proof) that none of them compute that function.... Then if Church's thesis is false, it is refutable by finding a counterexample; and the more experience of computation we have without finding a counterexample, the better confirmed the thesis becomes."""" (italics in original, p. 20)

""""Thus, the sun always rises because the sun has always risen."""" Truth by enumeration: animal logic. Bertrand Russell would have a field-day. At least Boolos and Jeffrey offer us a """"road map"""" of how to go about approaching the problem. But they fall into the same trap: they are asserting that if a computational procedure isn't mechanical then it must be intuitive. Say what? that the world of computation is divided into two mutually-exclusive sets: """"the intuitive"""" and """"the mechanical""""? Sure sounds like dualism to me ... intuitive 'minds' with 'souls' vs 'brains'made of gooey mechanical stuff ... interesting... most (but not all) philosphers of mind have given up on 'souls' ... maybe here is how one disproves or proves dualism? To wit: 

What would be interesting would be if someone could prove that the truth of the Thesis is formally undecidable in any construct whatever, """"intuitive or otherwise"""" forever unknowable to man or machine or God. One little [dualism] difficulty: what the hell does 'intuitive' really mean? [maybe that God is punching holes through the 5th dimension into our 4-D space-time, and is seeding minds with """"notions"""" (but not mechanically altering them in the process)?] 

I would call this sort of discussion a 'foundations of mathematics' debate, and therefore an open topic in some domain or other. Whether its 'philosophy' or 'foundations of mathematics' I don't know. I think they are the same.  wvbailey

Vandalism warning
One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

Why Wikipedia Must Jettison Its Anti-Elitism

By lsanger in Op-Ed
Fri Dec 31, 2004 at 12:42:24 AM EST
Tags: Internet (all tags) TABInternet
TAB

Wikipedia has started to hit the big time. Accordingly, several critical articles have come out, including """"The Faith-Based Encyclopedia"""" by a former editor-in-chief of Britannica and a very widely-syndicated AP article that was given such titles as """"When Information Access Is So Easy, Truth Can Be Elusive"""".

These articles are written by people who appear not to appreciate the merits of Wikipedia fully. I do, however; I co-founded Wikipedia. (I have since left the project.)

Wikipedia does have two big problems, and attention to them is long overdue. These problems could be eliminated by eliminating a single root problem. If the project's managers are not willing to solve it, I fear a fork (a new edition under new management, for the non-techies reading this) will probably be necessary.

TAB
TAB
Let me preface this by saying that I know Wikipedia is very cool. A lot of people do not think so, but of course they are wrong. So the following must be taken in the spirit of someone who knows and supports the mission and broad policy outlines of Wikipedia very well.

First problem: lack of public perception of credibility, particularly in areas of detail. The problem I would like to point out is not that Wikipedia is unreliable. The alleged unreliability of Wikipedia is something that the above (TechCentralStation and AP) articles make much of, but that is not my point, and I am not interested in discussing that point per se.

My point is that, regardless of whether Wikipedia actually is more or less reliable than the average encyclopedia, it is not perceived as adequately reliable by many librarians, teachers, and academics. The reason for this is not far to seek: those librarians etc. note that anybody can contribute and that there are no traditional review processes. You might hasten to reply that it does work nonetheless, and I would agree with you to a large extent, but your assurances will not put this concern to rest.

You might maintain that people are already using Wikipedia a lot, and that that implies a great deal of trust. This is true, as far as it goes; but people use many sources that they themselves believe to be unreliable, via Google searches, for example. (I do so all the time, though perhaps I shouldn't.) Perhaps Wikipedia is better described as one of those sources regarded as unreliable which people read anyway. And in this case, one might say, there's no problem: Wikipedia is being read, and it is of minimally adequate and increasing reliability. What more could you ask? In other words, why does a perception of unreliability matter?

I am willing to grant much of this reply. I think merely that there are a great many benefits that accrue from robust credibility to the public. One benefit, but only one, is support and participation by academia. I am on the academic job market now and I felt it was necessary to explain my views about Wikipedia's credibility for potential employers. A great many of my colleagues are not at all impressed with the project; but more about that in a bit.

Another benefit accruing from robust public credibility is even more widespread use and support by teachers, schools, libraries, and the general publicprecisely the people who want to use what they believe to be a credible encyclopedia. To the extent that the project is not reaching, and being supported by, these people, it is not succeeding as well as it might.

Perhaps you might also maintain that, while Wikipedia does not now have a reputation for reliability, it will eventually, once enough studies proving its reliability are done, and once people are more familiar with the concept behind the project. This is hard to argue with; but it is also hard to support, because it involves predicting the future, and the future, when it comes to public opinion, is extremely unpredictable. It would be better to do something to help guarantee a reputation for reliability.

Wikipedia has another sort of credibility problem, mentioned in passing above, and I fear that time is not a solution to this problem, the way it might be to the foregoing one. Namely, one can make a good case that, when it comes to relatively specialized topics (outside of the interests of most of the contributors), the project's credibility is very uneven. If the project was lucky enough to have a writer or two well-informed about some specialized subject, and if their work was not degraded in quality by the majority of people, whose knowledge of the subject is based on paragraphs in books and mere mentions in college class",0

Evils of Atheism

It's about damn time somebody taught atheists their own medicine, and before you ask, I do not generalize, I think there's a cultural distinction between atheism and nonbelievers. Atheists tend to be enraged over religion of any kind, and spend a lot of time elevating Darwin and bemoaning the Crusades. Nonbelievers in general - say, someone who's raised a Christian, believes the Bible is an allegory, and only attends church for a funeral or perhaps at Christmastime - tend to adopt a """"Whatever gets you through the night"""" philosophy and be quiet on matters of faith. It's sort of like the difference between a devout vegetarian and someone who hates the taste of meat. Atheists are proud of their hate. It is something that they love devoutly and use it to hate christians.""",1

I didn't realise that the losses were so bad that the entire legion had to be reformed from scratch, and that the *replacement* 9th Legion appeared to have been wiped out some time later. 
Also, re Lang Vei, I was looking for accounts that tell the story from the Vietnamese point of view - there's lots of stuff on various heroics by Americans, but nothing about how the battle was planned and executed by the Vietnamese. This would tie in nicely with your Night Combat, because clearly it was an attack designed to use the night as a tactical advantage. And the use of tanks was a fairly radical departure in that context. I'm guessing the US forces must have been aware that tanks were in the area, because there were around 100 LAWs rockets issued to the base, but the preparedness for armoured attack is also not really covered in the article except to say they 'weren't ready' for such an attack. This doesn't make much sense - if they were issued with a huge ile of anti-tank weapons then they *must* have expected such attacks? Again, it would be useful to hear from the Vietnamese on their opponents preparedness or otherwise. Normally of course, the history is written by the victors - but not in this instance!

Goldman had wanted the wives to be depicted as model-like women who dressed provocatively.

Advice
To save me writing too much, a lot of this is going to be links to existing policies and guidelines - there is plenty of advice available, in fact a confusing amount, so pointers may be helpful. The guide to writing Your First Article and the Business' FAQ are particularly useful.

Wikipedia frowns on writing about your own organisation because of worries that someone with a conflict of interest will not be able to write from the Neutral Point of View which is one of our three key content policies. (The others are Verifiability and No Original Research). However, the anonymity of account names means it can't be prohibited, and it may be better to have a declared interest than somone pushing a case anonymously.

It should be possible for you to write an article about your organisation that won't get deleted, if you are careful. The first essential is to avoid any hint of promotion - be drily factual, as though you were unconnected with the organisation and had no interest in it, but were documenting it for completeness. See the guideline on peacock terms.

The next point is likely to be the problem if your organisation is new - notability, which is the Wikipedia term for """"of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article"""". See the guidelines on Notability and Notability (organisations and companies). What you have to do is find references from reliable sources which are independent of you. Your own web-site etc are not considered independent. Has there been comment on your organisation, e.g. in the trade press? It may be that you will have to wait until you are more established and can cite independent references.

I wrote the above off-line: now that I come to post it, I see you have run into another problem - copyright. That's more of a problem than you might think, because everything in WP must released under the """"GFDL"""" which says that anyone may do anything with it including rework it for commercial use - so just saying """"I agree to this being put in"""" is not enough. The notice above tells you what you can do, but for the reasons in my third para above it is very likely that your mission statement will not be in suitable terms for Wikipedia, so the solution to the copyright problem may well be to rewrite it. That leads me to a last warning: an important difference between Wikipedia and a business directory is that you will not own your article - see WP:OWN - other people can and will edit it. See the warning at the bottom of the page you use to edit: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.""""

"""== Categories related to the National Audio Theatre Festivals page ==

It is unclear why a number of categories were removed from the National Audio Theater Festivals page. I can only assume that the person who made the changes did not read the page carefully. The remaining categories imply that the NATF is simply an American radio drama performance festival and """"artists collective"""".  

The festival is not a performance alone, but comprises a professional organization - not a """"collective"""" or amorphous """"group"""" - of audio engineers, sound artists, voice actors, playwrights and producers. Its yearly event, also known as the National Audio Theatre Festival, involves several days of instruction, training, special talks and other discussions on these topics. For example, training in sound mastering, sound production, voice acting.  The Friday night performance is the """"cherry on the sundae"""". 

It is one of the only conferences of its type worldwide. Many of the participants do NOT work on the radio at all, but in audio books, film or animation, and likewise, while all the training involves the audio arts, it is not just an """"audio drama festival"""". The upcoming 2011 festival, for example, will be focusing on voice acting in animation.

Several of the categories are rather egregious removals, such as """"Audio plays"""", """"radio drama"""", """"sound recording,"""" """"sound technology"""", and """"voice acting"""", for which NATF is one of the only national training grounds or gathering for professionals... and even as other pages in those categories that are affiliated with NATF or are similarly themed stay in those categories. I therefore have returned most of the categories back.

The Saskatchewan Party is a centre-right political party in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan.  The party was established in 1997 by a coalition of former Progressive Conservative and Liberal members and supporters who sought to remove the New Democratic Party from power.

Is that how you assess content? By making a shallow assumption on pen-names? Expectations? The God-given right to anonymity on the Internet? How fucking petty are you and the idiot who made you an administrator? What next, are you going to ban Iranians from editing or contributing to Iran-related articles? Indeed not just a laughable policy, but indeed a dangerous one as well. Most of the world-class authorities are Iranians. With your fucked up logic, we should dismiss their contributions because irrespective of their content, you'll instead look at their political affiliations and their names and put it into the bin of rejection. Oh right, you're Swiss and because Switzerland is this shining paragon of neutrality hosting thousands of bank accounts of Islamic terror organization, you're obviously this stereotypical neutralist... Good lord, listen to yourself. 

Luckily academia doesn't work like that. Scholarly enterprise and political affiliations remain strictly separated. So it doesn't really matter if Kaveh Farrokh or anyone else is a self-declared outspoken Nazi, Communist, Socialist, Liberal, Conservative or what have you, it has no bearing on content that must be assessed purely by content. That's NPOV. A sober, neutral, objective approach, just bare-bones, bare-knuckles source critique. Source. Critique. Make an assessment on the content, not the person(s). You marginalized IranianGuy. Period. And as conveniently as you shrugged him off because of his pen-name, you shrugged off his fully legitimate criticism of your approach. No matter what country or pen-name or real name you have, it has a universal stamp: Asshole behaviour.

 Russian and Indian economies 

If you check the the numbers, you will see that on most economical measures Russia has a larger GDP than India, such as nominal GDP. As nominal GDP represents total market value, it is most frequently used when talking about superpowers. India has a larger PPP GDP, but Russia has a much higher per capita GDP than India in both categories. Overall, Russia has a higher HDI index. Your statement that India has a higher GDP than Russia is accurate in only a narrow sense and based on a single GDP calculation. 71.112.145.211  

India is way ahead of Russia in terms of GDP (PPP) (see List of countries by GDP (PPP)) and just behind Russia in terms of GDP (nominal) (see List of countries by GDP (nominal)). We are talking over here national economies and not just economy from per capita perspective. Also, India has a higher GDP growth rate than Russia (see List of countries by GDP (real) growth rate) and according to BRIC report, India's GDP (nominal) will be four times that of Russia's by 2050 and that is a very important factor considering this is an article on potential superpowers.   

 India is not way ahead of Russia, Russia is way ahead of India. Everything in India is Russian suchs as military arsenals, rockets, missiles, fight jets, commercial jets, ships, subs and etc. Russia is a superpower and India is not quite a superpower. There are many reasons why Russia is a superpower and that is a long discussion. Russia is the number military forces in the world and the worlds largest military arsenal builder. India is a big population and smart people but Russia is has unique things about it that India hasn't.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 78.129.197.69

Vandalism

this action here is considered vandalism. A consensus had been reached to name the page. Please refrain from unilaterally moving the page again without proposing a move.  (Roger - Out) 

If sticking to a Wikiproject guideline is considered vandalism then you need to familiarize yourself more with Wikipedia's rules mate.   

Exactly it's a guideline not a rule, there are exceptions to the guideline, even the project mentions it. There was a consensus on the name and my point here is that you are trying to ignore the consensus and impose your personal interpretation mate.  '(Roger - Out) 

Firstly, that consensus'' you are talking about was reached by only two editors including you. Secondly, exception is when the title does not sound phonetically correct for example """"Anglo-Indo relations"""", """"Franco-Indo relations"""", """"Sino-Indo relations"""". Also note that """"Indo-"""" is a norm when linking anything to India or the Indian subcontinent. For example, Indo-Aryans, Indo-Iranian languages, Indo-European languages, indologist, indology,",0

Jason shows no notability other than being on The Ultimate Fighter where he was pulled from competing because of an illness. TreyGeek and myself both agree that the page be deleted.

Jeremy May's article should be deleted because he also shows no notability other than being on The Ultimate Fighter. The other thing about May is, he doesn't even compete in mixed martial arts any more. He has not fought for any big promotions and holds no titles. There is no reason for him to have an article.

I'ld like to retrieve one small item from the above hidden stuff. Martin's remark """"the answer is 2/3"""" and mine, """"no, the answer is switch"""". I did not mean to imply that the 2/3 should be made completely invisible. Of course one must emphasize that a good *reason* to switch is because the probability is 2/3 that you'll get the car this way. It is even a very very good reason to switch, since it is can be shown (if all doors are initially equally likely to hide the car) that you can't do better; in particular, complicated strategies of sometimes switching sometimes staying depending on specific door numbers lead to a smaller chance of success! (Morgan et al; Gill).

I hoped that this remark of mine would help show that by careful choice of words it's possible to write sentences which many more editors could agree with. And which everyone can agree are not misleading and which everyone can agree reflects what is in the literature.

Remember: Vos Savant and Whitaker ask what the player should do. Introducing probabilities into the story is one way of finding justification for an action. The phrase """"the probability"""" leads straight to controversy, at least to disagreement (both among editors and in the literature). The phrase """"what action should the player take"""" leads to concensus (both among editors and in the literature).

 Cleanup 

The constant edit-warring on this short little article has got to stop, so I'd like to bring up the edits by  in the hope of generating some discussion and reaching a long-overdue consensus.

1. The first sentence says tomoi is the result of """"Siamese influence in the area"""" and provides two references. However, this is not in the given citations. These references deal with the history of the Thai community in Kedah, but make no mention of tomoi or kickboxing. Am I wrong?

2. The word tomoi is usually said to be a cognate of dhoi muay rather than a derivative term. Anyone fluent in both Malay and Thai will be aware of the many cognates such as the words for """"lizard"""", """"door"""", """"key"""", and the numerous Sanskrit-derived terms. Muay or moi comes from the Sanskrit mavya, therefore it would be incorrect to say that one derives from the other. They are similar because they come from the same source and because the two countries are neighbours.

3. I wrote in the article that tomoi in the Malay language refers to the local style of kickboxing while tinju is the generic word for any boxing art, particularly the western kind. I sourced a dictionary for this sentence. Yet the sentence has been edited and now defines tomoi as the """"sport of Siamese Kedah"""", while still retaining the given source. In other words, it's not in the citation given, once again.

4. Why is so much emphasis given to Kedah when the art is most often associated with Kelantan? This is consistent with the sources provided since all of them mention Kelantan. A major reason why the sport is not so well-known today is because it was banned in Kelantan where it was most popular. The state government even planned to rename tomoi """"Kelantan boxing"""". Yes it is practiced in Kedah and other states as well, but to state conclusively that tomoi comes from Kedah is simply not supported by any source or even general public opinion.

5. The first few sentences of the history section are atrociously-written and repeat some of the same material which I had already written in and sourced.

6. Language like """"it is a clear fact"""" seems pointy.

7. The first paragraph of the history section does not deal with tomoi or any martial art. Why does it matter how many temples are in Kedah? What does the dominant religion or language of the state have to do with anything? The same two references are provided for the paragraph once again, and neither are relevant to the article. But the sourced paragraph is followed by the sentence """"The art of """"Tomoi"""" or """"ToiMauy""""(ต่อยมวย) were teach and practice among these Siamese communities in Kedah and Kelantan"""" which is unsourced and entirely POV.

8. The origin of Indochinese kickboxing is a disputed topic. Authors like Draeger mention Chinese and Indian influence on muay Thai, which can logically be extended to tomoi, pradal serey, etc. But then there are those (unreliable) sources which claim bokator as the common ancestor. I thought it fair to say that their origin is unclear. Yet the article states very conclusively that tomoi is of Siamese origin and goes on to mention the regional styles of muay boran. Silat Embo (the precursor of tomoi) and Siku 12 (a related style) are not mentioned.

9. """"It is also a clear fact that the system of Tomoi, be the guard,stance,and striking techniques, is identical to Muay Thai."""" This is actually true. And putting aside any modern political boundaries, tomoi is the same as muay Thai and Muay Lao. I can say this from personal experience. However, that doesn't necessarily mean tomoi came from muay Thai. As mentioned before, they may all have their origins in Cambodia or somewhere else.

10. The history section continues by saying that boxers originally wrapped their hands in hemp ropes, and provides an irelevant source which only deals with muay Thai in Thailand. The editor then goes on to say that these hand-wraps did not exist prior to Ayutthaya. First of all, boxers fought bare-fisted before the custom of wrapping the hands. And more importantly, sources like Draeger say the date at which boxers first began wrapping their hands """"cannot be known with certainty"""". And even if the practice does not predate Ayutthaya, that doesn't mean it comes from Ayutthaya. And even if it does, that doesn't mean tomoi comes from Thailand. That's quite a stretch.   """,0

Rand is not a philosopher
I don't think we ever resolved one big problem with the article: Rand is not a philosopher. The article continues to push the POV suggestion that she is indeed a philosopher, which is an opinion only supported by her and her followers. There is only one professor in all of academia that supports the idea that she is a philosopher, and thus the article is pushing an extreme minority view as the truth. We are essentially doing the complete opposite of what we are supposed to do with psuedoscience articles in an article about psuedophilosophy. The NPOV warning will remain on this article until we truly resolve this dispute.  LGagnon 

A few suggestions for what we should do with this article:
Change the infobox to Template:Infobox Writer
Remove all POV claims that she is a philosopher; replace them with something along the lines of """"Rand claimed to be a philosopher.""""
Do not refer to Objectivism as a philosophy; a term such as """"ideology"""" would be more neutral.
Remove categories that refer to her as a philosopher.  LGagnon 

Also, I'd like to point out this line from the article:
Rand viewed herself primarily as a novelist, not a philosopher  LGagnon 

Response to Suggestions

There are too many conceptual difficulties with LGagnon's suggestions. Again, we need good grounding, not unsourced opinion.

To begin. The distinction between philosophy proper and pseudo-philosophy requires a fleshing out of criteria. Don't conflate Anglo-American analytic philosophy with the ubiquitous  belief-system development that preceded it. Or you can scrub virtually all Continental systems (endless varieties of Existentialism(s))from the category (of philosophy).

In fact, the analytic of North America is merely a method for doing philosophy. It eschews systems as such, due to the influence of empiricist/positivist skepticism going all the way back to David Hume. (Recall Hume awakened Kant  at least so Kant relayed  from """"dogmatic slumber."""" Philosophy has not been the same since.)

Further, though we speak of belief-systems, since the decline of the Middle ages, and the notorious rote of the Trivium/Quadrivium, these systems have been increasingly secular and secularized in knowledge and value emphases. 

In that respect, Objectivism is no less than its equally original, equally American conceptual cousin: pragmatism. Indeed, LGagnon's very student-musings about the exact status of Objectivism in this regard remind one of the reception pragmatism suffered (and suffers still) by comparison to earlier Theocentric philosophic systems. William James famously claimed that the very first real lecture on philosophy that he ever attended was the one he himself taught.

Ergo, """"ideology"""" would not be a neutral mode of reference with regard to Objectivism anyway. That loads the controversial """"Objectivism-as-cult"""" smack into the supposedly neutral explication of the system. It utterly distorts the sourcing and external material that is required by Wikipedia. It loads original opinion/research of the most expansive sort. It fails to unpack the place of reason in the Randian corpus. 

Oh incidentally, many, very many philosophers in the analytic school disdain the Continentalists as philosophers. They used to refer to them, when favourably disposed, as philosophes  a la that great Continental Trio of the Enlightenment, Rousseau, Voltaire, Montesquieu). Othertimes, analytics would dismiss your average Continentalist as a """"philosoher-manque.""""

Ayn Rand did not consider herself primarily a novelist. She explicitly addressed the issue of the novelist-philosopher distinction and with characteristic disdain: sneering at what she perceived to be the implication that one ruled the other out. She could not have been more univocal on the symbiotic connection she saw between the two. This is very serious indeed. AOluwatoyin""",0

Dear Sniperz11, Thanks for your help, advice. We shall try our best to bring Brahmo upto acceptable wiki standards. Please keep checking that page every 2 days or so and post on the Talk page there. Actually there is a distinction between Brahmo(s) and Brahmo Samaj. Brahmos refers to adherents (members) of the Brahmo Religion whereas Brahmo Samaj refers to """"followers"""" of the Brahmo Samaj (qv. Hindu Code 1955). So whereas all Brahmos are Brahmo Samajis, the reverse is not necessarily true, and which is why Brahmo and Brahmo Samaj cannot be merged and in fact will differ at certain places. However, this has nothing to do with the BrahMos missile and I foresee a disambigunation page for Brahmos sometime in the future. Cheers.  

Dear Bikash,
We have to improve the content on the page. Add infoboxes, images, and citations. Then we have to check all those spelling and grammatical things. After that we have to find associated """"Brahmo type"""" pages and add links from those pages to this article so that interested people can start editing this page. Sniperz11 point about Brahmo and Brahmo Samaj (commonalities / differences) has to be brought out so the pages are not merged. Bikash please create a wiki user identity.  """,0

Let me refresh your memory.

pjacobi: Delete - one person's theory, not in any way in contact with academic reserach. Pjacobi  

My response: Who cares how many people wrote it, or whether it is """"in contact with academic reserach""""? If you want to read about things that are """"in contact with academic reserach"""", you should subscribe to academic journals. Wikipedia is not an appendage of academia, and the CTMU nowhere relies on """"contact with academic reserach"""" to make its points. Please, let's keep our eyes on the ball here. Asmodeus  

Now please read carefully.

1. Most theories are written by one person; others are free to utilize them (or not) in their own work later on down the line, as they choose. That others have not yet chosen to do so need not reflect on the theory or its applicability to important issues, particularly given the polarization associated with the central focus of the scholastic journal in which the CTMU was published. This is not necessarily a reflection on the theory; it is more likely pertinent to the philosophical assumptions under which others are working, which - inasmuch as we are, after all, talking about philosophy - may ultimately lead nowhere. Indeed, it may merely mean that other scholars are unfamiliar with the theory because they only pay attention to a narrow or professionally closed set of sources. You have improperly recommended this article for deletion on those grounds, and that was wrong of you as a Wikipedia editor.

This leads us to

2. It makes no difference whether a theory is """"notable to academic researchers"""" (whether or not this is the case). It has been patiently explained to you that academics are not the ones who make this particular theory notable; it is notable because it was covered by highly reputable sources in the popular media, and because it has a remarkable structure that no other theory possesses. Again, citing the superficially apparent inattention of academia as grounds for deletion was irresponsible of you as a Wikipedia editor.

You have voted to delete an informative, well-verified article about a notable topic on irrelevant or nebulous grounds for which you have no verification. In so doing, you have let Wikipedia and its readership down. Please be more responsible about your editing activities in the future.  """,0

 was Canada's most important industry until the 19th century]]
Traditionally, Canada's Aboriginal peoples hold that they have resided on their lands since the beginning of time, while archaeological studies support a human presence in the northern Yukon from 26,500 years ago, and in southern Ontario from 9,500 years ago. The first Europeans to arrive were the Vikings, who settled briefly at L'Anse aux Meadows around 1000 AD, after which there was no further trans-Atlantic contact until John Cabot explored Canada's east coast for England in 1497, followed by French explorer Jacques Cartier in 1534. In the early 17th century, Samuel de Champlain founded the first permanent European settlements at Port Royal and Quebec City, from which the French colonists extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and the present-day Maritimes, while French fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana. Concurrently, the English established fishing outposts on Newfoundland and established the Thirteen Colonies to the south.
'' on the Plains of Abraham at Quebec in 1759, part of the Seven Years' War.]]

Due to the close proximity of these two European powers, a series of wars over both territory and the fur trade errupted between 1689 and 1763, such as the French and Iroquois Wars, the four Intercolonial Wars, and the Seven Years' War. Via the peace treaties that concluded these conflicts, Acadia and most of New France was ceeded to Britain, which then, through the 1763 Royal Proclamation, carved the Province of Quebec out of New France, annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia, and placed all the former French territories under common law; six years later, St. John's Island became a separate colony. By 1774, the Quebec Act reestablished civil law in Quebec and reaffirmed the right of its population to practice their Catholic faith, as well as expanding the province's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, all of which helped to fuel the American Revolution. From that conflict, some 50,000 persons loyal to the Crown fled to Canada, where new regions were created to accomodate them: New Brunswick was split from Nova Scotia, and Quebec was divided into Upper an",0

"The origins are very obscure. The Bedouin Arabs, who were the original followers of Mohammed and responsible for the first islamic conquests in Syria, Palestine, and Persia, were a nomadic people who lived in tents. In the cities they conquered they began by converting old buildings, and christian churches became mosques; in damascus a pagan temple transformed into a Christian church was incorporated into the Great Mosque (706-15). The earliest and one of the most beautiful of islamic buildings is the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem, built as a sanctuary (not as a mosque)[there's some debate about this] on a circular plan (685-705, but much altered later, especially in 1561 when the exterior was cased in Persian tiles and the interior lined with marble). The first minarets were converted church towers in Syria, and that built a Kairouan, Tunisia (724-7), is modelled on such a tower. True to their nomadic origins the Umayyad rulers preferred desert residences to town palaces. Several survive in ruins - Qasr al-Hair (728-9); Mshatta near Amman, Jodania; and Qasr at-Tuba in the Wadi Ghadorf near Amman. In plan these groups of buildings were derived from Roman frontier stations. Both religious and secular buildings of the period incorporate elements which were to become distinguishing features of islamic architecture: The horseshoe arch, tunnel vaults of stone and brick, rich surface decoration in carved stone, mosaic, and painting. During the Umayyad period the mosque took its permanent architectural for, dictated by liturgical needs - minarets from which the faithful could be called to prayer; a wide courtyard with a central fountain for ablutions, with surrounding colonnades to give protection from the sun; a large praying chamber, marked externally by a dome (as a sign of importance) and internally by the mihrab or niche indicating the direction of Mecca, towards which the faithful must turn in prayer. The last survivor of the Umayyad dynasty became the founder of the Emirates at Cordoba in Spain, where the early style of Islamic architecture was brought to perfection in the Great Mosque (786-990)
Under the Abassids who surplanted the Umayyads in 750, Persian influence began to dominate the Islamic world. The main achievements in architecture were the foundation of the new capital at Baghdad, built on a circular plan (762-7, now largely destroyed) and, slightly later, the smaller city of Raqqa, Syria of which little survives except its richly decorated gateways. It was at this period that Islamic architecture began to depart radically from Hellenistic and Byzantine conventions. An elaborate court etiquette, derived from persia and contrary to Bedouin ideas of informality, was introduced, and palaces were designed for the new caliphs on more formal and grandiose lines, e.g. the palaces of Ukhaidir and Samarra in Iraq. These large buildings were run up very quickly; stone was abandoned in favour of brick and there was much use of decorative stucco. The main C9 achievements were the great mosque of Kairouan, Tunisia (836); the mosque of Bu Fatata, Susa, Tunisia (850-1); the Great Mosque of Samarra, Iraq with its strange ziggurat-like minaret (c850) and the very well preserved mosque of Inb Tulun, Cairo (876-7). Buidling materials were usually rough but dressed with intricate geometrical or floral surface decorations in painted stucco, mosaic, glazed tiles, or shallow relief carving. Local traditions influenced the decorative styles in various regions (See Indian pakistan, persian and turkish architecture)
''In the original nucleus of the Islamic world the most notable later mosques are those a Tabriz, Persia (1204), Cairo (Mosque of Sultan Barquq 1384) and Isfahan Persia (1585). Most of the earlier religious builings, including the Masjid-el-aksa and the dome of the rock in jerusalem, were also altered and more richly decorated in these centuries. In southern spain a local style of great oppulence was developed; it's principle monuments are the Giralda tower, Seville (1159) and the Alhambra (1309-54)",0

In my late teens, prior to joining the Navy, I had ambitions that exceeded my financial means. I wanted to be a lawyer. 
Fate would provide a different path in my life, but in those days I used to go to the courthouse in Morganton, NC when I had a chancejust to watch the lawyers argue cases. I dreamed about someday being able to present cases like many of them did.
Once in a while, the presiding Judge would stop everything and recognize Senator Ervin, who would show up in the court to watch the proceedings. Once recognized, the Senator would usually stand up and give some folksy, always humorous, anecdotal speech that made everyone smile-even the guilty. Of course, this was usually in traffic or small claims court. 
A lifelong Republican, I have to admit that I retain a great admiration for the intelligence, wit, and the man the Senator Ervin (a Democrat) was.

"""I've listened to your comments and tried to find constructive ways to improve the article for all to enjoy, but clearly you have an entirely different agenda in mind.  I never made a claim that this was my article you continue to assert.  Instead, I transcluded an already excellent, public domain article into WP format and I cited the original article.  I then expanded the article in areas where I knew interesting and relevant background was missing, and others in our community have already begun to do the same.

Your views on this issue have already been adequately discussed in their entirety on the Village pump (policy).  You made your assertions and the consensus viewpoint of the WP community is that: U.S. Government sources, including images and text, are a valuable resource for WP, should be used to the fullest extent, and that using the FBI material in its original form is not only appropriate, but even preferable in this case.  I'm including the complete, unedited (and certainly not paraphrased) discussion in a new section on this talk page  From the Village pump (policy)  for all to view.  

 From the Village pump (policy) 

Is it okay under IAR to create a Wikipedia article which is a verbatim copy of an identical article appearing on a U.S. government website, i.e., a website in the public domain?

A recently added (May 5, 2007) Wikipedia article is a Wikified, word for word copy — both text and photos — of a 14-page article which appears on the FBI’s website at http://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/spyring/spyring.htm, titled Federal Bureau of Investigation, Famous Cases: 33 Members of the Duquesne Spy Ring.  The recent Wikipedia article that was copied from that FBI website is Duquesne Spy Ring.  The Wikipedia article originally carried the {USGovernment} template, but did not cite the current FBI article as the article’’s source.

The word for word copying of the entire text and photos of a 14-page article in the public domain and inserting that copied article in Wikipedia seems to me (technically and ethically if not in fact) to be plagiarism, even though the work copied is in the public domain.  If it is considered to be plagiarism, what can be done about effectively flagging readers that the copied article is a direct copy from another source?  I think the text of the {USGovernment} template isn't adequate for this situation.   
It's not plagarism, so long as it's indicated that the text came from somewhere, and was not just originally written. It's best not to do verbatim copies for NPOV reasons, but so long as the source is given, it's not terrible. - moo! 
I agree that the standard text of the {USGovernment} template isn't adequate for this situation.  Rather than say """"This article incorporates text from ..."""", it would be much more accurate to state something along the lines of """"The original version of this article was copied from ..."""" so that readers are clearly informed of the extent of the copying.  To list the FBI website as a """"source"""" clearly understates the copying.  In the context of an article or paper, this would be akin to copying passages without showing them in quotes and merely listing the source in the bibliography.  Almost everyone would consider that plagiarism.   talk 

This bothers me... even if it is not plagiarism (ie even if we give credit to the cite where it is copied from) wikipedia should not simply copy another site.  We should write original articles based on the information obtained in reliable secondary sources.  I could understand basing the bulk of this article's information on the FBI site, but we should at least paraphrase it instead of copying it.  I would love to flag it for improvement in some way, but I am not sure if there are any tags that apply.  

To be clear, the article always referenced the FBI as the source of substantial content and no claim to the contrary was ever made  in the original document a URL was provided and the reference was: """"Much of this article comes from FBI documents and photos released in 1985 under the freedom of information act and in the public domain.""""

What does seem to be controversial is the quantity of public information re-used in this Wikipedia article.  However, it is not illegal, unethical, and even uncommon for a private entity to re-issue and re-sell public information, sometimes adding value and sometimes not (e.g., [[Natio",0

"Vandalizing the Macedonian towns 

Freestypefrappe, I will not stay calm until you stop vandalizing the Kumanovo page talking only about murdering, blood, terrorism and nothing about the city normal life. Of course, there were moments in the Kumanovo’s history when a terrorist attacks took place, but Kumanovo is most of the time a quiet ordinary Macedonian town that doesn’t deserve such descriptions.  It is the same as if you write an article about London not mentioning St Paul’s catedral, Westminster, Tower bridge.. and writing only about recent terrorist attacks in the London underground. Talking about copyvios, I noticed that you are using text written by Christopher Deliso.  I found that on the following sites:

I may be wrong but your reference to WP:HiddenFunction concerns hiding text not to a collapsible table.
'''As of December 29, 2006, this technique is disabled on this wiki. The class hiddenStructure still exists in the CSS, but now outlines the text in green instead of hiding the text. This is to find any remaining instances of hiddenStructure in templates. Note that this only disables use of the CSS class hiddenStructure. It does not prevent use of similar tags like display: none or visibility: hidden.

The collapsible boxes contain information that serves as an addendum to what is in the article. It adds to the reading experience by making the page neater. The example I used with the """"Genes"""" is a prime example, looking at that abortion is enough to give somebody a headache.

The collapsible boxes I added in the Auschwitz concentration camp and the Mathausen concentration camp articles, among others, makes the pages look neater and more interesting. Nobody has complained about:WP:ACCESS.

Your contributed article, Polyurethane foam
 Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Polyurethane foam. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Polyurethane. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Polyurethane - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

Well, not that i don't appreciate what you said, but even so, allow me to reply. 

Today there were the funerals of Enzo Biagi, a freeman as few remains in a world more and more without any respect for freedom (seen as a 'threat for the established order'). The oil price is flying to 100$ and this should led to think more seriously to our absurd world. But let's go:

1-there is someone that is costantly pointed at the 'words' while others are pointed on 'facts'. Since you call my comment 'above' as non-polite, obviously you miss why i could be not friendly with someone that not miss a time to complain in Arbcom every time we discuss in any sense. This is 'polite' and wikilove for you? To me it not looks so. Since i am a volonteer here, not payed (as all the collaborators as well), you cannot pretent i act like all the conformists here have established, and obey to Bzuk or BillCJ every time saying 'yes master, yes master, like you want master'. And surely i wouldn't take EH as 'bright example'. Sorry, the manner in which they acted not displays any reasonable friendly-acting. So it's hard pretend to me to be so kind with gentlemen that not even bothers to explain why they does this and that revert.

2-Another thing that show dramatically well some things: 

Take for instance, the first paragraph after the header """"Technical description""""...the paragraph ends with the sentence """"the only real all-around fighter that served in AMI, but this was not without limitation in every task."""" That's a very subjective statement, and, since it's making a judgement, it really needs a citation so that the reader can understand what the source of that statement is. As it stands right now, however, because it is not cited, it merely looks like opinion on your part, which would be right to remove/revert.

All the G.91R page explains continuosly why this plane was 'limited' and 'mainly successful as recce'. I cannot understand how this thing, considering all the datas and stuff given, can be 'questioned'. Rather than criticize me just try to get a look about the JAS-39 Gripen. 

Basically, questioning this fact shows apalling comprension for all the article, because it's a statement well placed inside the meaning of this work.

3-Washing your hands and not bother about to collaborate with me is not surely a 'nice' manner to do. Strangely enough, this is 'justified', rather than be a guilth. So, basically, every thing i do or not do is wrong, while every thing you do or not do is right. With these bases, expecting a costructive dialogue is just funny. You have been 'offensed' by the vanification of F-104S adjustements (because i after done some more contr.). This is the only thing you did in over a month of 'collaboration'. Too easy, my dear, to self justify all times like you. Easy not bothering to collaborate, while the guilth is mine that already lost my time to contribue gratis to this ency.

4-My contributions should be alway quoted here and that. But being serious, there are a lot of pages without any or almost any references. I dont' understand why i should be whipped to post 500 kb. The issue about F-86 data touched the buttom of the sea and dig it too. I cannot cope with someone that not even read online sources with absurd reasons.

5-The continuos accuses, diffamations and so on about me are not liked either. Perhaps the problem is that Wikipedia takes herself too seriously in the last times? Perhaps that be called 'traitor' or 'harmer' is not friendly? Obviously you rate these accusation as 'righful critics'. But not i.

I remember very well that you accused me without any proof to make copyviols, even with funny interpretations of Goebel PD text (that i stated as not mine, the only time i used other texts in all the MB written for the sake of Wiki). I wouldn't have a judge like you in the real world, believe me.

6-The fantastic wikioz world, 'tooooo perfect' to be 'questioned'. But to me and some others, this looks not exactly true. There are a lot of burocrats, hipocrites and trolls, or simply there are a lot of guys that basically fears the others and are ready to 'defend the Revolution' with zealot fanatism. Questioning even the basical celebral activity and even the basical freedom of spreech, questioning even the simply syllogism. 

All this is due because, as always in these cases, from French revolution today there are always many 'revolutionary guards' ready to show their 'loyalty' to the 'cause'. So wikipedia prefers executes guys 'out of the chor' instead to admit to have some 'contradictions'. This is the usual manner to act. And i have no love to who call me 'wiki.harmer' just because i show that i 'know' my stuff, not only 'have read it somewhere'. This is why Goebel and many others keeps away from",0

Gotcha.  You're saying if it went Republican, it did so against the net effects of the Jews.  What I'm trying to tie in here is if enough Jews """"defected"""" to make the difference e.g. if 80% of Jews going Dem became 60% because [Bush/W. Bush/etc...] had enough appeal.  I'm claiming Jews can influence a race not only by going solidly Dem, but also by deciding not to.  The article I cited states the amount of time candidates spend on Jews is precisely because they (~20% of them) are swayable.  That being the case, narrow Republican victories could also be a result of Jewish response to a candidate.

This being the case, 2000 Florida could be a result of Jewish voters if either: (1) enough Jews were attracted to W. Bush to throw the state, (2) the state actually went Democratic by voter intents (again this is possible but contentious, or (3) Jews made the race close enough to require Supreme Court intervention, which is itself a political outcome and has profoundly influenced the voting method there, as well as affected ideas about W. Bush.  If any one of these three is possible, we can't discount the effect of the Jewish vote in Florida 2000.  """,0

 Request opinion of Muslim editor 

Hello. Could you please stop by Talk:Christianity and give your opinion? We are debating whether the word 'monotheism' should be included in the intro to the Christianity article. According to most dictionaries, the definition of monotheism is The dogma or belief that there is one God. Now, all Christians believe there is one God and all Christian creeds (such as the Nicene Creed and Chalcedonian Creed) profess a belief in one God. The point of contention is the Holy Trinity. Christians believe that God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit all make up one [[Ousia|essense] of God, i.e. are three parts of one God (known as hypostasis). Now, several editors think that because this is different from the Islamic view of Tawhidand they alledge Muslims think Christians are not monotheistic, but [[tritheistic]we cannot say Christianity is monotheistic like is done in the Islam article. Many editors content, however, that the definition of monotheism is based solely on belief, not truth. So if Christians believe their God is one God, they are by definition monotheistic, even if they may not be right. All it takes to be monotheistic is to believe there is one God. Others, however, think we can only say """"Christianity is a monotheistic religion according to its followers."""" Again, some editors (including myself) have issue with this because it's basically like saying """"Christianity believes it believes that there is one God,"""" which of course is redundant. In my opinion, monotheism by definition is the belief! None-the-less, we would like to know from a Muslim editor: 1) Do Muslims view Christianity as tritheistic? 2) If so, does this view affect that fact that Christians think their God is one God (even though they may not be right), and if not, aren't Christians by definition monotheistic? Sorry for the long post, but there's a lot of debate I had to summarize. Thanks, — """,0

 The Cramp Twins 

The Cramp Twins is an animated series created by cartoonist Brian Wood. The show was produced in association with Cartoon Network Europe. It is about Lucien Cramp (Kath Soucie) and Wayne Cramp (Tom Kenny), not-so identical twins who live with their hygiene-obsessed mother (Nicole Oliver) and their Western-obsessed father (Ian James Corlett) in the fictional town of Soap City. Wayne and Lucian's personalities clash, and they rarely get along. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe (Lee Tockar), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Reverend Andrew Sparks) has a crush on him, but he hates her. Wayne's and Lucien's teacher is Miss. Hillary Hissy (Demi Buchanan, who also plays Tony's mom Lily and Mrs. Winkle). Lucien's friends include environment-friendly Tony Parsons (Terry Klassen who also plays Tony's dad, Seth) and Mari and Luke Harrison (Adam Little).

Season one premiered in the UK in September 2001 on Cartoon Network (UK) and on February 2, 2002 on CBBC on BBC One respectively and has reached high popularity with children. Season one ended on 21 June 2002. A second season premiered in Autumn 2003. Season 2 finished in 2003.
Season 3 started in 2004 and ended in 2005. Season 4 began in 2006 and ended that same year.
The show is currently licensed to Cartoon Network.

The show was originally canceled in the US in February 2005, when Mew Mew Power (aka """"Tokyo Mew Mew"""") was airing in its slot February 19, 2005, and it was originally intended to be a sneak peek for the series to air September 2005 with Cramp Twins continuing to air there, but 4Kids TV decided to cancel The Cramp Twins to put Mew Mew Power in its slot. A press release went out about a possible 3-part finale answering any unanswered questions, but the show returned in the summer of 2006, and later with more new episodes.

 Main characters 
 Lucien Cramp: Lucien is the smarter of the twins, but also considered the 'eco-loser'.  Gentle and sensitive, Lucien is frequently bullied and name-called by his brother; Wayne's favourite choice of addressing Lucien is """"Girlpants"""", but he sometimes calls Lucien a """"nerd"""". Lucien enjoys science, nature and is a vegetarian. Lucian longs for a pet, but due to his mother's extreme cleaniliness rules, he is denied owning any.  Secretly, Lucien keeps a worm farm under his bed, that only Tony, Mari, Wayne and Wendy know about. It is shown in many episodes that Lucien has a fear of clowns. He has many skills, including knitting, and has shown interest in playing the harp. Lucien likes going to Soap City's only swamp (the only place he gets peace from Wayne, who is afraid of the place) where Tony lives. Lucien is technically the older twin as he was born first in the opening credits. Lucien Cramp is voiced by Kath Soucie. 
 Wayne Archibald Cramp is the blue-skinned antihero of the series. He is taller, destructive, and the less intelligent of the twins. Wayne is obsessed with junk, which he collects and hides in his room; he spends most of his time at the junkyard, owned by only friend, Dirty Joe. Unlike Lucien, who loves the swamp, Wayne is terrified of the place, and also has a fear of frogs. Wayne is constantly annoyed by Wendy Winkle who has a crush on him. Wayne's only love is anything sugary, his main source of energy, and if he is deprived from it, he becomes tired and speaks nonsense. Wayne likes to give the impression that he's the best-behaved of the twins to his mother, and sometimes Miss Hissy, but in truth, he likes to manipulate to achieve his goals.  Sometimes Lucien who gets in trouble for Wayne's behaviour, although in many episodes, somehow the tides turn and Wayne is punished by pure coincidence. Wayne is vo",0

 Demand for too many sources 

Some people have demanded way more sources than are necessary for this article. For example, the request for a secondary source for the fact that The Inquirer has criticized the publication of EG's real name. This is utter rubbish. From WP:NOR:

An article or section of an article that relies on a primary source should (1) only make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge, and (2) make no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, explanatory, or evaluative claims.

The section in question states: """"The Inquirer has criticized this deletion[8] as well as the revelation of the model's real name during the deletion discussions by Wikipedia users (the model's name and identity had been kept confidential by The Inquirer).[9]""""

We comply with (1): the claim is only descriptive (it reproduces what the Inq stated in their article) and is EASILY verifiable. The information is also not interpreted, thus we also comply with (2). As such, I'm removing the redundant second source.

Further, I recently added a citation for Mike Magee's quote from BusinessWeek. Again, I am removing this. The quote appears in the earlier reference to the same BusinessWeek article, and citations are allowed to span multiple sentences. """,0

"Comic book citation
Thank you for providing sources in The Darkness (comics). Template:Cite comic contains instructions to correctly cite comics as sources; repairing existing citations or introducing new, properly cited sources makes it easier for Wikipedia's readers, particularly those unfamiliar with The Darkness, to recognise and find the sources on the Internet. If you proceed in copy-editing, too, you can help the article ascend to good article status. Those processes will make your previous blocks less likely to be taken into consideration by other editors, while the latter will also show a skill in expression which I have noticed that you possess.

One might count the Ptolemies as the Thirty-second Dynasty, but I don't know if any reliable sources do so. They're either called """"the Ptolemaic dynasty"""" or """"the Ptolemies"""" or """"the Lagides"""".

"""==Author's comments==

I posted the following comments on the userpage, but moved them now to this talk page with minor edits:

The following changes are suggested:

 Mark """"Requests for Adminship"""" as historical, and open the new process, """"Sysop Applications.""""
 Replace the standard three RFA questions with the six questions shown below.  
 Question 3 - how the applicant intends to use the sysop tools - is similar to old question 1. 
 Question 4, asking for the applicant's article writing experience, is based on old Question 2. 
 I have removed old question 3 about conflicts with other users.
 Questions 1 and 2 are added to establish minimum criteria.  Only one user (Lustiger.seth) who failed these criteria has become a sysop in the last several years.  Having these criteria on the application should eliminate the need for WP:NOTNOW closes to premature RFAs.
 Questions 5 and 6 are added to establish the candidate's character for honesty.  Why this wasn't done years ago after the Archtransit scandal is hard for me to understand.  Disclosure of material negative information should be expected of all applicants.
 Remove the old system of voting """"support"""", """"oppose"""", or """"neutral"""" with a reason in your vote.  Instead, vote """"support"""" or """"oppose"""" without giving a reason.  Then, if you choose to give a reason, you may comment in the """"Concerns"""" section or on the talk page of the Application.
 This change will reduce the """"pile-on"""" effect of oppose voting.  Normally, in old RFAs, support voters vote without saying much, whereas oppose voters write long comments.  The oppose votes are disorganized insofar as oppose vote number 13 may refer back to oppose votes number 2 and 6.  The cumulative effect of oppose votes with long reasons is to say """"we hate you.""""  
 The new model removes this asymmetry.  You can still oppose, but you can't say more in your oppose vote than a supporter would say in her support vote.  The cumulative effect of bare support and oppose votes is """"some of us like you, and some don't.""""  To the extent that reasons for opposing the candidate need to be explained, the voter can explain in the """"Concerns"""" section.
 No """"neutral"""" votes.  If you don't want to vote, nobody is forcing you.  Neutral votes are pointless.
 We can decide later what a passing score should be.  For now we can allow bureaucrats to use their discretion as they currently do.

The following features will be maintained from the old RFA process:
 Bureaucrats decide the outcome after a 7-day discussion.
 A nominator may praise the candidate.  That is probably the one positive aspect of old RFA that is worth preserving.

 Hi, Pompous Ass!  ;) 

I know you think you're some kind of poker authority on Wikipedia, and that it's somehow your perogative to give the Imperial final thumbs up or thumbs down on what's acceptable regarding anything to do with poker here, but guess what? That's not the case. You are one of MANY arrogant, conceited, self-absorbed losers that populate Wikipedia who use this site as some sort of self-esteem builder, because here you can act like a """"big man"""", and make unilateral decisions on what's acceptable or unacceptable here.

The edits I have made (and will continue to make) on the Jack Straus entry regarding his death doesn't violate policy in ANY way. If I had the time or the inclination, I could spend several months quoting entries and instances on Wikipedia where editorial verbiage is used. You are simply a pompous ass who thinks you are the gatekeeper of anything poker-related on Wikipedia. You are not, and you will not censor me. And as I'm sure you've already realized, my ISP address constantly changes, so you won’t be able to block me, either.

While I certainly don't condone the incivilty, Damiens, the impression I'm getting is that you can be a pretty frustrating guy. I also get the impression that you don't see that as a bad thing, but frustrating people into submission or Godwin's law isn't the way to win an individual argument or your NFC crusade. You're nominating images for deletion left, right and centre based on technicalities in the NFCC policy and NFC guideline without regard for their encyclopaedic benefit or the spirit of those rules and you're weathering editors down to the extent that you're driving them away from uploading images or even from contributing by tagging their images at a near-robotic speed and frequency. That's not what the rules are for, that's not what Twinkle is for (as your previous trips to ANI should have made you aware) and if that's what was in the best interests of the project, we'd have a bot doing it. You've been offered a perfectly dignified solution that would allow you to continue the good that you do while mitigating the negative effects in the form of a voluntary undertaking not to nominate more than two images per uploader per day. My advice to you would be to take the offer and save us all some time—the laternative is that somebody will take this to ANI or ArbCom and we all waste a lot of time with the result that you're formally restricted from doing what you could restrict yourself from voluntarily.  | Penny for your thoughts?

Since one of my friends disappeared in mysterious circumstances, leaving his tent and personal effects behind, from an expedition while investigate a Noah's Ark hoax, I bring a certain need for academic or even journalistic accuracy to the subject.

In particular, I have become aware of evidence about the device used in the 1985 Wyatt survey - and had posted a critical comment - with supporting links to Creation Magazine.

YOU'RE CONTRADICTING YOURSELF! Basically your opinion of based on blindness and bullshit as far the """"evidence"""" you send me are considered.

Really? Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is. You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes. Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

"List of ice hockey teams in Ontario 

I updated Template:OHL and Template:Defunct OHL to try to simplify things. Template:OHL contains all teams past and current for the OHL. Template:Defunct OHL contains all past teams from the OMJHL and the OHA Junior A. That template may need to be renamed. 

Regarding the article List of ice hockey teams in Ontario. How should we handle the defunct teams from the OHL, OMJHL, and OHA Junior A?  
That is a really good question.  I would like to add them, as it would allow the list to be both complete, and consistant with the others.  I havent added defunct Jr A teams on any other article, but many of these OHA Jr A teams were the highest level of Junior hockey at the time, I believe, so should be added as being equivalent of Major-Junior.  However, that will likely make this a really long list.  It might make sense to split the article into two: active and defunct  as I did with the baseball lists. I would suggest expanding the defunct teams and seeing how long the article gets, then deciding from there.

 Rename article, reorganize subcategories, and incorporate Jesus in Islam as a mainstream """"portrait"""" 

The article's title is misleading. It leads us to believe it will be an article on historical (historicity) of Jesus. In fact, it is an article on Historical Portraits of Jesus, and should be named as such. 

Secondly, the subtitles need to be renamed/reorganized, and some material needs to be shifted into different categories. The entire """"cultural background"""" subsection is Christian POV and should be named as such. Historical elements needs to be largely removed, since this article is about portraits, and some of the further subsections of that category are already covered in the Historicity of Jesus article, and are in fact duplicated there. 

And thirdly, and perhaps most glaringly from a secular POV, this article needs to incorporate Islamic portraits of Jesus (Isa Ibn Maryam عيسى) This portrait needs to be a """"mainstream"""" portrait. If this portrait is not included, then the article needs to be renamed Historical Christian portraits of Jesus 

These recommendations would be a good start in establishing the NPOV of this article   """,0

Oh, my is that any way to address a person on their talk page? Did you really just call me an """"obnoxious little shit""""? You can just imagine what I think of you. Well, I guess that means the gloves can come off since you started it. 

I wonder what exactly you do here on WP? It is obvious that you want to be an administrator but you have failed to show the deportment and maturity of mind to make the grade. Instead, you choose to act like a self-appointed wikipedia police, running about throwing up the blue flags of WP rules and being a generally obnoxious person with no real use. Instead of actually contributing useful original edits to articles you seem to think this is the old Newpedia where people are expected to submit edits for your approval. If too many others take the same tac WP will collapse into dross. You violate every rule in the book of which you accuse others. You are a mean spirited, very angry person that drives away editors with your sarcastic responses and general high-handed behavior. I suspect you have no real special knowledge of any of the articles upon which you squat like a vulture waiting tear apart others creative edits. You really need to crack a book and study up on a subject or two and find an article you feel needs rewriting and to straighten out the too turgid, redundant writing that exists here on WP. Stop trying to act like you are an administrator and grow up.

At a time when WP needs more editors, particularly female, you with your coarse, rude behavior is the last thing WP needs. You are, to summarize it, a net negative.

If you choose to unblock him, I am not going to labor the issue with you personally, our friendship is certainly stronger than that, but others may not be so forgiving unless there is a clear path forward.  In my opinion, there is trollish behavior involved, crafty but subtle.  As always, anyone is free to discount or ignore my opinions if they so choose, without fear of reprisal.   - 2¢  ©  Join WER",0

 Helwett and Packard 

@benwikler @swombat @TarenSK -> @aaronsw -> www.aaronsw.com -> pinboard.in/u:aaronsw -> TinyURL.Com/SerEntr has typo: """"Helwett and Packard""""

Before complaining about the typo, I did Google search to make sure I had the name spelled correctly. To my surprise, I found about 2,500,000 matches for the wrong spelling.

Does anybody have any idea why? Is this some kind of (derogatory) running joke.

 I don't think any human can accurately and knowledgeably curate hundreds of pages a day. I've been doing this as one of my principal activities for 7 years now, and I“New Peugeot Glenmarie 3S Centre” learned I can not maintain a high standard if I do more than 20 or so of the same thing at a time, for any WP process. Some people manage 50. Except for correction of trivial errors, I don't know of anyone who does many more than that  successfully. And certainly not for 7 or 8 hours at a stretch.
It's not that you make many actual errors. It's that you don;t follow up what other things the contributor may have written, and that   you are almost always content with the form notices. I too use them most of the time, but when I see someone who seems to need assistancewhether the assistance is to stop trying the impossible or advice about what specific kind of referencing will help the article, I don't wait for them to come to my talk page, but give it.  You do help them when they come here, but most people won't do that. They just go away. What we need to do to keep WP going is to get more initial contributors to remain active.

3. People that reverted were mainly Irishpunktom and you, both known for their pro-islamic POV and regularly cooperating in edit warring (also regarding several other articles, such as Apostacy and dhimmi, for instance, in order to press pro-islamic POV. All this indicates a coordinated campaign in order to press Islamist viewpoints.

""":, please consider my beer analogy again.  It would be quite easy to find reliable sources saying that beer is made from malt, hops, yeast, and water.  Many people think this is the only way true beer should be made.  Nevertheless some people do make beer out of other ingredients.  Now it might be correct to say that 'traditional ale' is made only of these ingredients and it is certainly true that beer made according to the """"Bavarian Purity Law"""" should be made from only these ingredients.  

Is there no way you can temper your claim and also make it strictly more accurate and informative by saying something like 'traditional Korean kimchi is always fermented'.   

To:User:Martin Hogbin: Look. I would do it if it were true to my knowledge and/or there existed some reliable sources to confirm that. The saveur.com article, the only source against my claim that I consider at least semi-reliable, says """"It can also be eaten before it is allowed to ferment"""". Do you think this confirms the existence of unfermented kimchi against all sources I gathered? Someone might like to have a bite of Sauerkraut before it is fermented. 
I don't want to argue with you or something, but I have heard that beer is made from only malt, hops, and water in Germany (as it should be). Unfortunately, at least in Korea, Japan, and the U.S., most beer includes rice, potato, corn starch, and many other ingredients I think unnecessary. At least they have ingredient lists on the bottles, and there are a lot of official documents on those additional ingredients.
But kimchi is a different story. Like I said, I have never seen any packaged/jarred kimchi labeled """"unfermented"""", maybe except for Japanses """"kimuchi"""" which is more like pickled vegetables. And both traditional and contemporary kimchi is fermented. (they are not much different anyway.) Nevertheless, I am willing to temper my claim if editors can find even a couple of reliable sources that say some kimchi is unfermented.

 Corrections to discussion about sky glow in LP page and in main sky glow page. 

1. Light is scattered by molecules (Rayleigh scattering) and aerosols - not """"refracted.""""
2. Aerosol scattering dominates in most places - in """"clear ir"""" (see Garstang, 1986, PASP), the total scattering from aerosols is ~10x that from molecules.
3. Aerosol scattering has almost no wavelength dependence, reducing the dominance of blue light influence below that expected from pure Rayleigh scattering and the RSI of Keith.
4. But, the Purkinje effect makes the eye more sensitive to white/blue rich light when dark adapted (most relevant when looking at/adapted to sky glow; only marginally relevant when looking at/adapted to outdoor night lighting levels), increasing again the dominance of white/blue-rich sources.
5. The Bortle scale has made very little or no penetration into professional astronomy - astronomers, when they characterize skyglow at all, still use mag/arcsec2.  Bortle scale is being used by amateurs and is being investigated in some detail by US National Park Service as a useful scale to characterize night sky quality.  Finally, the Bortle scale uses much more than just sky glow to characterize skies.

"Summary of situation  User:ShimShem has taken a dislike to this article, and has tried numerous methods to either get it deleted or its name changed. 
 1) Completely invalid speedy deletion request
 2) Invalid DRV request
 3) Nominated for deletion via AfD, despite the fact that it had passed an AfD this year - in fact the AfD was withdrawn at 6-0 for Keep
 The current AFD here stands at 9-0 for Keep, but despite that, ShimShem has wikilawyered all the way through it - once it became clear that it was going to be kept, they decided a name change would be better...
 4) Changed the name of the band in the article, and was told to take it to talk
 After a brief non-discussion on talk, moved the article anyway, and was reverted

I was originally unsure of the motives of this editor - why they were completely desperate to delete or move this article - until I noted they were interested in Tamil subjects, one of which is M.I.A. (artist), and guessed that they believed that the two could be confused.  Their subsequent creation of the article M I A as a redirect to M.I.A. (artist) proved this, as far as I am concerned.  

As to whether the band is actually called MIA or M.I.A., it differs.  The band itself uses M.I.A. as the heading on their own website, but then uses a combination of both elsewhere.  Since in the case of most sources, this is only likely to be laziness (much as R.E.M. are regularly referred to as REM), and since the article has existed here for a while, and that all the backlinks go to this version, and most of all because we shouldn't let disruptive users get their way, the article should stay here.",0

Speedy deletion of Howevercomma
 A tag has been placed on Howevercomma, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G1 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the page appears to have no meaningful content or history, and the text is unsalvageably incoherent. If the page you created was a test, please use the sandbox for any other experiments you would like to do. Feel free to leave a message on my talk page if you have any questions about this. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

If the point is that Warren and his church are viewed as controversial in some circles and that some substantial, clear (particularly to those unfamiliar with the American cultural stew from which this springs), additional detail should be added to the articles (both here and at Rick Warren) to reflect that, then that should be argued.

"""""""List of United States cities by area"""" says Sitka, Alaska, has 4,812 square miles, of which 2,874 are land; Juneau, Alaska, has 3,255 square miles, of which 2,717 are land; Anchorage, Alaska, has 1,961 square miles, of which 1,697 are land; and Jacksonville, Florida, has 874 square miles, of which 758 are land.

""""List of cities by surface area"""" matches that, except that it mentions """"Juneau City and Borough"""".

The pages about those four individual cities today have figures that match, too. Yet, when I posted in this section several days ago, the article on Jacksonville said 1,962.4 square miles.

Jacksonville's own government website says it has 841 square miles, not 874 or 758.

I'm not sure whether some people or governments are rightly or wrongly putting all of a county's land into the city's listed area. I can say that, in the case of Jacksonville, although the governments of the (a) City of Jacksonville and (b) Duval County are unified, there is (or ought to be) separate reckoning of the city's and county's area, because Duval County also contains three other cities (Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, and Neptune Beach), which are not part of the City of Jacksonville (they have their own, separate police departments, for example—even though the Jacksonville Public Library is county-wide).

The government website of the City and Borough of Juneau says it has 2,593.6 square miles of land and 487.6 square miles of water, for a total of 3,081.2 square miles. Neither the total nor the land area there matches what Wikipedia gives.

At the government website of the City and Borough of Sitka, I haven't found the area.

Same for the government website of Anchorage. But it does link to anchorage.net, which says the city has 1,955 square miles—which, like the government figures for Jacksonville and Juneau, doesn't match Wikipedia's figure.

"the “40,000 protesters” myth 

I understand that some members have a politically motivated desire to make the 2010 election look as sinister and anti-democratic  as possible, but you have to get the facts straight about these four sources on “40,000 protesters”.1. This one shouldn't be considered altogether. It is a UNHCR page quoting instead of a reliable news source a Washington-based “foundation” whose purpose is: “to inform and educate policy makers and the broader policy community about events and trends in those societies which are strategically or tactically important to the United States and which frequently restrict access to such information.” . It is a politically biased organization, not an independent news source. So, out with it!2. These two ,  are respectively the Voice of America and MSNBC (not MSNBC really but a direct quote from Bloomberg here). So in reality it is VoA and Bloomberg. Well, let me inform you that we are talking about the same guy - his name is James Brooke, as anyone can plainly see since 2006 he has been stationed in Moscow to report for Bloomberg and as of last summer for the VoA as well. Leaving aside the fact that the VoA is more of a propaganda tool fully owned by US government rather than an independent news source, let's see how Mr. Brooke came about this magic number - “40,000”. Apparently he was there, but did he count the demonstrators himself? No, he quotes Associated Press: “Within an hour, the Associated Press was estimating the turnout at 40,000.”!  Well, it wasn't. Anyone can see the number of AP and that number is 10,000. A little white lie, Mr. Brooke. Or maybe I'm too harsh, maybe AP did broadcast that number intially, but then seeing how preposterous it was quickly brought it down to what all the other major media guys were reporting. In any event, this “40,000 people” thing doesn't hold water.3. Basically the same goes for CBC as well. As I already said in one of the comments not only CBC didn't have its own staff in Minsk that night (I checked this myself here in Toronto with CBC Headquarters), anyone can see how heavily in that article it relied on other media: “Reuters reported...The Associated Press reported...”. As we know already from these ,  quotes both Reuters and Associated Press mentioned 10,000 protesters each.
Given all the above I'm removing the “40,000 people” part from the article.",0

Tyrannosaur grid diagrams
Hey, I saw you had done several other of the grid diagrams for some of the smaller coelurosaurs and was wondering if you had time to do some for the """"Big 5"""" tyrannosaurs. Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus don't have any... shouldn't be too hard, they're pretty identical. Tarbosaurus is grid-less too. Also, the ones currently on Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus (made by some other guy... not DINOguy, let alone DinoGuy2) have a weird scale... on *D* each grid square is .6m on each side, and on *T* they are .9m on each side. Seems like it would make more sense to be a square meter like you have. Plus they have a comma instead of a period, which no English-speaking country uses (this is English Wikipedia after all).

 Sure, what we're looking for is reliable sources. That means we're looking for guarantees of reliability in the source, like having been published in an academic journal. Further, we want to avoid sources that represent only one person's view on the topic, since we're obviously not going to have a paragraph on everyone who's ever said anything about Hamlet.

That's why we want to see academic journals.

"vulcanization is not synonymous with curing
After making the changing discussed immediately above, I reviewed the article further and find that this confusion is more deeply imbedded in this article.  The entire first paragraph equates vulcanization with any type of curing of sulfur - which is not the case.  Curing of rubber with some process has indeed been around for long before the Europeans discoved rubber, but the term vulcanization was coined specifically to refer to the curing process that involved the addition of sulfur at high temperatures.",0

Perhaps it would make sense to move some of the stuff from Terrorism against Arabs back here, if we came to having 2 distinct articles once again? For instance, Lord Moyne was not much of an Arab (though they were his favorites, I guess), so his assassination by Stern gang belongs more to Israeli terrorism Uriyan

 Facts about Israel (note that many of the statements on this page are disputed)

With all the due respect, I don't think this link should be applied on this page, for several reasons:
 It is not about Israeli terrorism, but about general Israel-bashing
 It contains mostly incomplete and partial information. For instance, the green Palestinian number plates was something they asked for. Israeli Arabs have regular yellow plates, and because of that are sometimes targeted by Palestinian gunmen.
 Many of these statements deserve a proper discussion, in Wikipedia, not out of it.  Uriyan

The USS Liberty incident is generally thought to have been an Israeli mistake.

 The USS Liberty was a US Navy ship. It was flying a Navy ensign. It had guns on it. Since it wasn't civilian, engaging it at sea does not have anything to do with terrorism, and has no place on this page, which is about terrorism. Uriyan

 Uriyan

This sentence has been removed from the article about Kach. """"They have also organized murders and beatings of Palestinians in the U.S.""""
 Really?  Who?  

I too am curious about this claim. It is so vague and undocumented that it does not belong in the article. Can someone provide specific claims, and a few sources for us to check out? Also, I do not understand what this has to do with the government of Israel. I agree that it is theoretically possible for a few fanatic right-wing American Jews to carry out such a thing. But (A) there is only a vague allegation being made, and (B) this has nothing to do with the Israeli government, nor the pre-Israel proto-state in the British Mandate of Palestine. We can't simply lump all crimes done by Jewish people into the category of """"Israeli terrorism"""". All crimes committed by Arabs considered Palestinian terrorism (No.). 

Unless these acts were committed by agents of the government of Israel, why are they listed as """"Israeli terrorism"""" instead of """"Jewish terrorism""""?  ~~

I'd tend to agree with Zoe here about the title of the article being wrong. Since it's so """"controversial"""" coming up with a universally-acceptable definition of """"terrorist"""" vs. """"freedom fighter"""", maybe we should just have """"Violence against Israelis"""" and """"Violence against Palestinians"""" pages, or some such?

 Such pages exist (at least for Palestinians), but nobody bothers to update them. It's much less sexy than """"Israeli terrorism"""". 

Then maybe this should redirect to """"Violence against Palestinians"""" (after moving the content of this page & its Talk there, of course)?

The page I had in mind was Palestinians killed by Israelis, but I support leaving """"X terrorism"""" pages, because of the difference between spontaneous violence and pre-calculated killing, which is terrorism. 

Actually, I was thinking of very neutral titles (such as the """"violence"""" ones above), chucking in all the text from any non-NPOV-titled articles scattered about (they can be smoothed out later) and redirecting to the neutral-titled articles. It should make NPOV easier to maintain. I'd lose the """"terrorism"""" pages entirely in the process (dumping their text & talk into the new articles), as we're never going to agree on which acts are """"terrorism"""" and which are not (and you know we're not, yeah?). If the articles just give the facts then we can leave """"terrorism or not?"""" decisions up to the readers.

 Having considered the concept, I support it. In the text itself, we would then have the freedom to describe which actions exactly can be considered terrorism and by whom. 

(bloody hell, did we just agree on something, Uri? Will wonders never cease?)

 Yes, we did agree, and I'm glad at it. I hope it'll be a good beginning for tomorrow - I've got to log out now.

What more information needs to be added?

References, for one. Two college newspaper citations and two MySpaces doesn't cut it. I tried to look for some myself, but google yielded very few related hits. More than ten minutes of recorded output, for another. A label. Right now, the whole thing smacks of blatant self-promotion, and that isn't what Wikipedia is for.  

is there a way i can get that page(s) back so i can save it and re-enter it when they have more references?

Any admin should be able do that for you, I think.

I know you guys are going to jump all over me for this but the word """"retarded"""" has two very different modern meanings.

The meaning of """"retarded"""" changes significantly depending on how you use it, unlike """"fag"""".

As for the word """"jerk"""", I hear it used almost every day on Wikipedia, & never have I seen anyone blocked for it, unless there is a really degrading or profane word in front of it.

The first block was justified but the second just wasn't; I was just explaining to Chillum my reason for the rant I posted & he assumed that I was trying to say the rant over again, but not in the same words.

Proposed addition of two See Also and two references

If there is no objection, I propose to add two See Also:

Community Open Source Program Office, Open Source Investment Strategy (late 1990's)
Report to the Director of Central Intelligence, the Challenge of Global Coverage (July 1997)

The first was written by Joe Markowitz, the second by Boyd Sutton.  Both are stored at www.oss.net with
persistent URLs, so hopefully we are over the """"self-promotion"""" bit.

If there is no objection, I propose to add three links in references, all to actual documents:

General Al Gray, Commandant of the Marine Corps, """"Intelligence Challenges of the 1990's,"""" American Intelligence Journal (Winter 1988-1989).  This was the first-ever public call for changing the focus on intelligence from the Soviet Union to revolution, crime, and terrorism; and also the first-ever public call by a Service or Agency head to shift emphasis from secret to open sources.  
Joint Military Intelligence Training Center, Open Source Intelligence Handbook (June 1996)
Special Operations Forces Open Source Intelligence Handbook (Strawman)

All of these are visible with links via www.oss.net/BASIC.  If BASIC can be locked in and protected, perhaps there is no need for the added references, but I suspect my work, which has now survived three days, will be vandalized eventually, so I defer to the group on what is best.

Nancy Reagan

I didn't want to revert your edit without asking why you thought that we shouldn't refer to Ron Reagan as """"the late"""". This means the guy has dies, which is true. 

I think that we need to address a couple of issues there. To begin with, I understand your reasoning for not referring to a deceased person as """"the late so-and-so."""" To begin with, we aren't the World Book Encyclopedia; we are Wikipedia, with a different Manual of Style. I see nothing in there that directs us not to refer to the deceased as I have. The very fact that you have had long arguments about this suggests that it is a matter of contention, and not one that has been resolved with any finality. That being said, I did inquire with the Manual of Style folk regarding this matter. If they come back with the determination that """"the late"""" is not appropriate, i will remove the reference in the article myself. until then, I am going to reinsert the comment as is. 
As to the comments that most already know reagan is dead is not an entirely valid argument, aas WP is not a collection of links. We cite our work, yes, but each article should be able to stand on its own, without assuming information. There are people who don't know John McCartney was in a band before Wings, or that Jimmy Carter was a former US President. We assume nothing at Wikipedia. As well, we are not here to improve the print encyclopedias, and I am not sure where you arrived at that assumption.
As well, I am curious as to why your user page says that you have retired from Wikipedia when you are still editing.  

I can tell from the number of edits you have performed over this issue that you don't agree with my edit. I think that if you wish to address Wikipedia policy, you should do so in either MOS or at the Village Pump. If you wish to discuss the matter, then do so in the Discussion area for the article. Please do not assume an editorial policy that is not in existence. 
Again, why does your User Page state that you are no longer contributing to Wikipedia? 

 The late """"the late""""  thanks. 

Referring to the recently deceased as """"the late"""" belongs no where in Wikipedia.  Thanks for taking notice of this overused and imprecise phrase and deleting it throughout Wikipedia.   
Hi.  I saw where you removed """"the late"""" from Lane Stadium in reference to Frank Loria.  In most cases, """"the late"""" isn't appropriate, however, there should be some designation here as his number was retired and displayed posthumously.

The TIGHAR-Nikumaroro Fiasco
Two years of speculation and hype came to a numbing climax on
March 16, 1992, at the National Press Club in Washington,
D.C. At a crowded news conference receiving national TV
coverage, Richard Gillespie, executive director of The International
Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery [TIGHAR], unabashedly
announced that the Amelia Earhart mystery “is solved.”
Since early 1990, following the group’s first excursion to Nikumaroro,
a 3.5-mile long coral atoll in the Phoenix Islands, about 2,100 miles
southwest of Hawaii and three hundred miles south of Howland Island,
the national media had touted TIGHAR’s theory that Nikumaroro could
be the final resting place of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan.
The “evidence” Gillespie presented included a battered piece of aluminum,
a weathered size 9 shoe sole labeled “Cat’s Paw Rubber Co.,
USA,” a small brass eyelet, and another unlabeled heel the group found
on Nikumaroro during TIGHAR’s highly publicized return there in
October 1991. These items, elaborately displayed and labeled in a glass
case, all came from Earhart or her Electra, according to Gillespie.
“There may be conflicting opinions, but there is no conflicting evidence,”
Gillespie said. “I submit that the case is solved.” Gillespie then
bit his lip and looked down at the floor — a curious yet revealing display
of body language for someone claiming to have solved one of the
20th century’s greatest mysteries.
Gillespie and Patricia R. Thrasher, TIGHAR’s husband-and-wife
team, theorize that through a navigational error, Earhart and Noonan
overflew Howland Island and landed on a reef on Nikumaroro during
low tide. There they died of dehydration a short time later. The plane,
they said, was washed over the reef when the tide came in and now lies
under 2,000 feet of ocean.
The April 1992 Life magazine featured a six-page spread penned by
Gillespie, who cites Navy pilot John Lambrecht’s July 9, 1937 report:
“Signs of recent human habitation were clearly visible [on
Nikumaroro], but “repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any
answering wave from possible inhabitants.” Gillespie called this report
“hugely significant” and “tragically inadequate. What had not been
done in 1937 had to be done now. We would have to search
Nikumaroro.”
Gillespie credited two retired military aviators, Tom Gannon and
Tom Willi, of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, for the theory’s origin.
“Using celestial tables, Gannon pointed out that on the morning of July
2, 1937, the rising sun would have provided the precise line of position
Earhart said she was running,” Gillespie wrote in Life. “By flying
southeast along that line, Noonan could be sure that, even if he missed
Howland, he would reach an island in the Phoenix group in about two
hours. Clearly it was the safest, sanest course to follow. I traced the line
on the chart and read the name of the island: Nikumaroro.”
This supposition was convincing to some, but Devine wasn’t
impressed. “There is considerable information in Gillespie’s rendition that
can be faulted,” Devine writes. “One example is his attempt to foster a line
between Howland Island and Nikumaroro. He presents Earhart’s last message
as ‘We are on line 157/337 ... We are running on line.’
Earhart never reached Howland Island. Earhart never
saw Howland Island, therefore Howland Island is not a reference
point for a landing on Nikumaroro. Earhart’s authentic
last message received by Coast Guard personnel on board
the Itasca, and recorded by Commander Thompson, related
no reference point: ‘We are on line of position 157-337 ...
We are running north and south.’ Earhart was not flying east
toward Howland Island or Hawaii. She was on a course, a
compass course or line of position 157-337, which terminates
on the island of Saipan.1
With Our Own Eyes
– 163 –
– 164 –
Earhart was not adept at navigation, and may have stated
her reading from a pocket compass she carried on her person.
She was probably and almost certainly stressed by ensuing
events, especially if Noonan had been rendered unconscious
during the almost disastrous takeoff of the overladen plane.
If Noonan had not been incapacitated, I assure you that he,
one of the best air-and-sea navigators of that period, would
have been communicating. He would have guided their
plane on a pre-arranged course, and calculated for accura",0

Yes. I wasn't denying that that was a consequence, but I just think to mention that but not the occupation is a major oversight. I don't think it's really arguable that the most long-lasting and significant consequence has been the illegal occupation, which continues to this day. That has been the source of conflict for over 40 years, with incalculable repercussions. I suggest adding after the above sentence:

 """"Another lasting consequence of the war that has had enormous repercussions and which helped establish the Six Day War as a watershed event in the Middle East was the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, which continues to this day.""""

That's perhaps not as brief as you were looking for, but I think this is crucial and its importance cannot be overstated. It deserves at least one sentence in the lede. I suggest concluding the lede with this. I've worded it in a way that won't be controversial, or require sourcing.   """,0

The organization of sub-topics. Culture is thrown way down towards the end, after economy and tourism, which is inappropriate. The information section is unnecessarily loaded with history and detailed geography, which makes it not only uninteresting, but also repetitive. Information is interspersed all through the sub-sections, without regard to whether or not they fit there. Eg, the Geography section starts with the fact that UP is the 5th largest state. That is not strictly geography, and belongs in the introduction. Climate belongs towards the latter part of the page, perhaps before toursim. Regions and cities is not such an interesting combination. In any case, """"Cities of Uttar Pradesh"""" can be an interesting topic on its own, because, UP has several interesting cities (and regions) each with specialities of its own (like the copperware of Moradabad, ceramics of Khurja and carpets of Bhadohi).

 etymology 

The family consists of the genus Aplodactylus. The name means either """"single finger"""" or """"simple finger"""" (Greek haploos / aploe + daktylos). [Sourced to Fishbase, depending on whether you look at Aplodactylidae or Aplodactylus-punctatus]
Is anybody able to look at Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1832? This is supposed to be the original source of the genus name, and conceivably gives some insight as to where the name was meant to come from. (Primary sources aren't ideal, but a self-contradictory secondary source isn't better.) Presumably there is some defining and identifying property of the fish's fin, which not only gives it the name but would more broadly also be worth mentioning in the article.   """,0

 Beta testing 

Hi there 7. I'm currently writing an editing tool for deletion tagging, . At the moment I'm looking for some users to do a bit of testing for me, as I haven't used all the functions myself. This would basically involve using the program from time to time, being prepared for it to mess up on you, and reporting any errors to me ). If you were willing to do so, this would be very helpful, but feel free to say no ). If you do decide to, please email me (so I have your email to send the program to).

"re webquest help links removed
I can't believe how you people run this place. WTF is wrong with you? There were 5 different linked sites that provided help on the Da Vinci Code webquests - 2 were for the original webquest and those links had been here on Wikipedia for several years without issue and were the most well-used resources for the webquests on the internet, and then 3 more links were recently added for help with the NEW Google webquests that just started this month. NOTE that these new Google webquests are not related to the older original webquests at all, and do NOT superced them in any manner. ONE person comes along who has created a new site that provides help ONLY for the NEW Google webquests (and no help whatsoever with the older original webquests), and this prat deletes ALL the links and information to ALL the webquest help sites both old and new, and replaces them with his own link, and when several site owners try to put their information back up, this clown repeatedly deletes it ..and then you mods back him up??? WTF is up with that??? PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR ACTIONS??? Your page now provides absolutely no links to help with the original webquests, and only one link for help with the new webquest, which is all thanks to this one selfish prat from googlefact.blogspot.com. Oh wait, there's one more link too, and that's to his mirror site at davinciquest.blogspot.com. How can you justify your actions? The owner of googlefact.blogspot.com also posted on the site of one of the links he removed (student-rant.blogspot.com), to laugh at everyone and thank us all for the traffic and the ad-impression revenue it is generating for him. AND THIS IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE SEEM TO CONDONE???? If you could give some reason for your actions then perhaps all of us site owners who were deleted could understand, but we do not see that there is any justification for what you have done, nor has anyone offered any. The ONLY message we're getting here is that it pays to manipulate Wikipedia for personal gain and delete everyone else's links but your own. WE HUMBLY REQUEST YOU RECTIFY THIS MATTER AND THEN LOCK THE PAGE TO STOP THE PERSON WHO STARTED ALL THIS FROM DOING IT AGAIN - which happens to be the one link you have left on the page.

The real problem is that User:Musical_Linguist has a personal grudge against me and vigorously hunts for and reverts all of my attempts at dialog with the rest of the Wikipeida community.  Clearly, Wikipedia, with 1,000,000 articles is now big enough for the two of us, but she a pretty and polite female and so she has the upper hand.  She seems to have nothing to offer the Bill of attainder aritcle except to hit the undo button if she thinks that I have effected any changes.  Surely, she has a personal motivation directed towards me personally.  That is not really how adminship is supposed to work, is it: that an admin can hold a grudge and personally hunt down an individual other person?  Is there not some mechanism by which she can be instructed to direct her attention away from my activities and let the other 800 Wikipedia admins perform the job of protecting Wikipeida from Andrew William Morrow?  If the problem is truly Andrew William Morrow, then it will be obvious to the other admins, but in fact, that has not been the case.  Oh sure, there has been the occasional problem (if you look at my Wikipedia work as indexed on my web site, you will see that I choose to focus on controversial biographies with a high content of U.S. case law).  This Irish woman has nothing to offer the articles she has personally targeted via this tool Template:Pinktulip except to hit the undo button. She has done no research.  She has conducted no dialog with other editors.  Like you, she always claims to be """"too busy"""" to engage in any actual dialog, but she has plenty of time to sit around and chat with her Catholic pro-life friends and hit the undo button every time she sees non-vandalism contributions that she simply does not like.  As you can see by her user page, she is highly prone to view the work of others through the rather narrow prism of her Pope's worldview.  If you study Special:Contributions/Musical Linguist you will see that she spends many, many hours on Wikiepdia every day and note the quick response time of her reverts: She must be monitoring her watch list vigorously.  Is this really what you want Wikipedia to be about?  Letting admins, no matter how polite, intelligent and pretty impose their worldview on others?  Is it such a tragedy to put some horse-blinders on her to say: """"For these specific users and these specific articles, you will stay away.  You have had much more than your fair turn at these specific users and these specific articles and now you, dear and valued admin, are being administratively rotated out of them and you will stay rotated out of them for a good, long time.""""  Is that such a tragedy?  Fred: It is only a tragedy if the problem is really within the admin herself, rather than within the targeted or banned user(s).  The mature admin would not take such instructions as an insult, but simply as a matter of due course.  Musical Linguist is much like the childless woman hovering over someone else's child, ever-ready to snatch the child and claim it for her own.  It is a natural impulse, but it requies intervention because it is also a disorderly impulse.  All I have done is to flush the woman out by getting her to fill out the """"Pinktulip"""" template completely.  Her contribution to the information content the articles listed in the Pinktulip template is zero, but but she now exerts total control of them.  She is merely a sterile, charming, controlling woman and she should herself now be controlled.  She is all process and no results.  That is not what Wikipeida was supposed to be about.

The Delphic Oracle is one of the earliest stories in classical antiquity of prophetic abilities. The Pythia, the priestess presiding over the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, was believed to be able to deliver prophecies inspired by Apollo during rituals beginning in the 8th century BC.[11] It is often said that the Pythia delivered oracles in a frenzied state induced by vapors rising from the ground, and that she spoke gibberish, believed to be the voice of Apollo, which priests reshaped into the enigmatic prophecies preserved in Greek literature. Other scholars believe records from the time indicate that the Pythia spoke intelligibly, and gave prophecies in her own voice.[12] The Pythia was a position served by a succession of women probably selected from amongst a guild of priestesses of the temple. The last recorded response was given in 393 AD, when the emperor Theodosius I ordered pagan temples to cease operation. Recent geological investigations raise the possibility that ethylene gas caused the Pythia's state of inspiration.[13]

One of the most enduring historical references to what some consider to be psychic ability is the prophecies of Michel de Nostredame (1503 – 1566), often Latinized to Nostradamus, published during the French Renaissance period. Nostradamus was a French apothecary and seer who wrote collections of prophecies that have since become famous worldwide and have rarely been out of print since his death. He is best known for his book Les Propheties, the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Taken together, his written works are known to have contained at least 6,338 quatrains or prophecies,[14] as well as at least eleven annual calendars. Most of the quatrains deal with disasters, such as plagues, earthquakes, wars, floods, invasions, murders, droughts, and battles – all undated.

Nostradamus is a controversial figure. His many enthusiasts, as well as the popular press, credit him with predicting many major world events. Interest in his work is still considerable, especially in the media and in popular culture. By contrast, most academic scholars maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus' quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so tenuous as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power.[15]",0

 Plot: 

The film opens with Lord Voldemort stealing the Elder wand from Albus Dumbledore's tomb and shooting a large bolt of lightning into the sky. It then cuts to Hogwarts which is no longer a colorful castle of magic, but a shadowy concentration camp surrounded by Dementors with the students being marched through the Entrance Courtyard. Severus Snape stands in the top of the castle and watches the students with a blank expression.
At Shell Cottage, Harry Potter sits in front of Dobby's grave, gazing into the one way mirror. He suspects that there is a Horcrux in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts so he, Ron and Hermione strike a deal with Griphook: he will get them into Gringotts Wizarding Bank to find the Horcrux if they give him the Sword of Gryffindor, a bargain to which they reluctantly agree. Harry then questions Ollivander, who examines and identifies the stolen wands of Bellatrix Lestrange and Draco Malfoy. While he confirms that Draco's wand is safe to use, he cautions Harry about Bellatrix's wand, as it is """"unyielding"""" and might be dangerous unless its allegiance has changed. Harry then asks him if he knows about the Deathly Hallows and Ollivander claims he does not think they exist, although Harry knows he told Voldemort about the Elder Wand and is determined to kill Voldemort first.

With Harry and Griphook under the Invisibility Cloak, Hermione disguised as Bellatrix and Ron as a foreign wizard with bushy facial hair, the trio and Griphook apparate to Gringotts. During the first phase of the mission Harry and Ron are forced to use the Imperius Curse on Bogrod to cover up Hermione's unsuccessful impersonation of Bellatrix. They manage to get into the vault despite their disguises being removed by The Thief's Downfall, and inside the vault they find Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, the Horcrux, but set off the Geminio curse, causing everything they touch to multiply exponentially. Griphook takes the sword from them after they get the cup, saying that he never said he would help them get out, only in. He runs for it and calls security, the trio are almost crushed by the gold and captured but Hermione gets them to jump on the back of a dragon kept as a security measure. Setting the dragon free, it wreaks havoc killing several goblins (including Bogrod), crashing through the roof and flying off with the trio on its back. After jumping off the dragon into a lake, Harry has a vision of Voldemort furiously killing Griphook and many other Gringotts employees and personnel at Malfoy Manor for allowing his Horcrux to get stolen. Choosing to keep Nagini by his side, he summons his followers and orders them to invade Hogwarts to ensure the Horcrux he hid there is still safe.

Having sensed Voldemort thinking of his Horcrux and Hogwarts through their connection, Harry tells the other two they have to go there and destroy it before Voldemort can get to it, and that Voldemort seems to be getting more fragile with each Horcrux destroyed. They apparate to Hogsmeade but immediately trigger alarms set up by Death Eaters, waiting for Harry. The trio are almost captured but Aberforth Dumbledore gets them safely into his home and berates them for coming to the village. Harry discovers that it was him who had been watching them through the mirror shard and him who sent Dobby to rescue them before after seeing the Two-Way mirror hung up on the wall. Aberforth provides them with food and tells them to give up on their mission, go into hiding and save themselves. Harry said that he trusts Dumbledore's judgement that the task has to be seen through no matter what, but Aberforth insists that Albus had left them a suicide mission and it was hopeless. After Harry insisted on finishing what he had started, Aberforth summoned Neville Longbottom through a secret passage behind Ariana's portrait to bring them into Hogwarts. Bruised and beaten by the Death Eaters of the staff, Neville and most of the students have been hiding in the Room of Requirement all year. They welcome Harry in with tremendous applause and jump at the idea of helping Harry finish Voldemort but Harry still doesn't know what the Horcrux looked like or where it was. After saying it might be connected to Ravenclaw, Luna suggests that Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem might be it, despite no one alive today having seen it. Ginny arrives and after gazing at Harry for a moment tells everyone that Snape was now aware of Harry's break in and wanted everyone in the Great Hall.

In the hall, Snape orders anyone who may hold information regarding Harry's location to tell him immediately or face punishment. Harry then reveals himself after hiding within the crowd and rebukes Snape for standing where Dumbledore once stood as Headmaster, ordering him to tell the students the truth of how he betrayed and killed Dumbledore as Order Of The Phoenix members enter the Great Hall.

 Waffen SS and Entire SS Organization: Hitlers Twisted ideology in a Uniform 

The Waffen SS is constantly portrayed as elite Combat Troops ONLY, 
using this pretext in an attempt to distance themselves from
War Atrocities. This attempt to gloss over events is more evident in
the recent Published accounts of select Waffen SS Divisions.
 The stated intent of some of these accounts is to exemplify
the fact that the Particular Unit was a Combat Unit only,
included in these accounts is Unit Histories and Formation
with claims of identical purpose as the German Army(Heer)
in certain Documentation included in these accounts provides
the information regarding the establishment of these """"Special

prove the presence of  deliberate deception and psychological

 Actually, I've been neutral towards the """"Paris area"""" proposition. 3 people have supported the move, 5 people have opposed it (including Jared's """"weak oppose"""") and 5 people have been neutral. Outside few exceptions like Bob's vote, most of the oppose and neutral votes were motivated by the fact that, in regards to the content of the article, the title """"in Paris"""" has been felt as already implying the Paris urban area in respect of English common usage and that adding anything wasn't formally necessary.
 We all know the reasons why you disagree with this general conclusion. By the way, the reason why I haven't opposed the """"Paris area"""" proposition is because I consider it as more legitimate than an even more blurry proposal such as """"Ile-de-France"""". Frankly, I don't know what to think about it. Perhaps we could already change the title to """"of Paris"""", and check out how the things go.

I stand by my deletion on the skepticism page. I didn't delete the whole article by any means. I removed the part about false skepticism because it is unprovable and inhereintly doesn't go together. False being the opposite of truth, and skepticism believeing nothing to be certain. To be a false skeptic is impossible to prove and is not a view point but a chance for people to oppose halocaust deniers and such in a biased way on the wiki. I believe that most likely the halocause for example happened, but I am not going to say it is """"false skepticism"""" nor are the """"sources"""" any more reliable or proving anything. So you know how to report better, have better contacts, and tend to have a majority(or enough active members) to back your agenda. Then martyr me and get it over with. It is better to delete it since I legitamately believe it to be unsalvagable and completly opinionated to the point that is pushes a biased agenda. The whole point of the page is for the reader to decide what is skepticism and to go from their. Lets make this more of a history book and less of a language arts book. More of a tratise on the basics of known science rather than meta physics and quantum theory.

I agree with Christopher Thomas, below, regarding unclarified sources for this article.  Specifically, I take issue with the entire """"Differences between the 800 and 850 series"""" section, because I contend that there is no such thing as a """"T-850"""".  Stan Winston Studios, which designed the terminators for the films, confirmed this to me via e-mail when I wrote to them asking their opinion.  Their response (direct quote): """"I'm not sure where the T-850 came from.  As far as I know, Arnold's Terminator has and always will be the T-800, model 101.  Now, the robot Terminators in T3 are T1's and Kristana Loken is the TX.  I hope that clears it up...""""  While the term """"T-850"""" is somewhat widespread on the internet, even extending to T3-related merchandise such as action figures, its origin is, to my mind, something of a mystery.  Rich 
 Stan Winston DESIGNED the Terminator, and he says it's T-800! Now shut the fuck up and change it back you idiot!""",1

The first claim cannot be justified by anything in the reference aimed to support the claim. The penal code changes are not about 'prohibits historical revisionism of genocides and crimes against humanity' as claimed above. The second one looks like as stated, but completed by the rights of the Croatian Parliament to interpret the same law - allows the nacionalistic ruling parties to adjust these changes to their current political aims.

 Why is the lingo/doublespeak/racist word """"contractors"""" used instead of the precise English word """"mercenaries"""" 

This is an encyclopedia not a press release.

Wikipedia is not supposed to be the house organ of any one government, but this article uses a lingo/doublespeak/racist term that the USA uses to describe mercenaries of any country other than a predominantly Caucasian political ally.

Wikipedia should be filtering out spin words an translating them into proper English.

I suggest that """"contractor"""" only be used for unarmed non-military non-police contractors.

This simple rule should apply:  If the term """"mercenary"""" would be used to describe the job or person if the person were being paid by an agency working for an African government, the term """"mercenary"""" should be used to describe the job or person working for a non-African government.

"New Orleans 

15. “During this period, Oswald began to consider returning to the Soviet Union or going to Cuba.” There is a no source cited here because it is impossible to know Oswald’s considerations. We can hypothesize but it is better to present the facts and let the reader do their own thinking. The statement is not fair because it grasps at the bounds of the imagination by assuming that the Mexico trip took place. Since that entire incident was even questioned by the Warren Commission’s own investigator  into the incident, Wesley Liebeler, the alleged Mexico trip cannot be used as basis for the conclusion that Oswald wanted to move to Russia or Cuba.

16. “The [pamphlet] trial got news media attention…” There was no trial. Oswald pled guilty to disturbing the peace and paid a $10 fine. (Warren Report vol. XXV p.117 Exhibit 2216.) The “ARREST” go media attention. Notably absent from the wikipedia paragraph is his strange relationship with FBI Agent John Lester Quigley, the first person to visit Oswald in jail.

17. “…Jim Garrison in his unsuccessful attempt to link Oswald to wealthy local businessman Clay Shaw.” His attempt was very successful. HSCA noted the credibility of Garrison’s link from Shaw to Oswald. It called the Clinton witnesses whom saw the two together. “The Committee found that the Clinton witnesses were credible and significant.” (HSCA Report page 171.)

18. Concerning Oswald and David Ferrie, “However, there is no credible evidence they had any significant contact when Oswald was a teenager.” The source cited is footnote #72, HSCA vol. IX p.103-115. While it would be correct to quote HSCA’s conclusion it is an outright lie to state this as a fact. In addition to the photo of Ferrie and Oswald together the Warren Commission took the testimony of Oswald’s high school classmates Fredrick O’ Sullivan (WC vol. VIII p. 27) and Edward Vobel (WC vol. VIII p.1) whom both testified to 15 year old Oswald and Ferrie meeting. Why would the Warren Commission be asking specifically about Ferrie if there was “no credible evidence”? There is also no mention of Ferrie’s motive for being with the teenage CAP. He would attempt to recruit teenage boys to molest. Both pro and anti conspiracy researchers including the Warren Commission have questioned Oswald’s sexuality due to his association with gay men in New Orleans.

19. “… [The Clinton witnesses] contained numerous contradictions to their testimony at the Clay Shaw trial in 1969, and to their testimony to the Committee in 1978.” Wikipedia editors hypocritically claim there is not enough space to include all facts and theories yet there is plenty of space to attack the Clinton LA witnesses again and again and again and again and again. Worse yet this statement is NOT in quotations as a conclusion of Gerald Posner as cited in Footnote #73. It is written in the article as an objective fact. If you are going to use statements from Posner then put them in quotations as HIS conclusions NOT facts.

 
 Return to Dallas 

20. “Oswald was last seen by a co-worker alone on the sixth floor of the Depository about 35 minutes before the assassination.” Another outright lie. Footnote #84 has cited the Warren Commission testimony of Charles Givens. The last witness to affirmatively see Oswald before the assassination was Carolyn Arnold in the lunch room at 12:15. (WC vol. XXII p. 635.) She was also interviewed by reporter Anthony Summers in ‘Conspiracy’ page 108. This lie speaks volumes as to Wikipedia’s intentions. They would rather mention a less significant witness simply to get in the statement of a “brown bag.”

  
In ‘Crossfire’ Jim Marrs attempts to present an even more detailed hypothesis for Oswald’s movements before the assassination but much of this is based on loose interpretations of witness statements.

It is very significant that Oswald was the ONLY employee whom did not eat their lunch outside or by a window in anticipation of the motorcade. Instead he stuck deep inside the depository in the 2nd floor lunchroom by the only accessible phone. The same room he was found in only 90 seconds after the assassination by Roy Truly and ML Baker. In ‘The Day Kennedy Was Shot’ Jim Bishop claimed Oswald salivated for 30 minutes by the sixth floor window awaiting the motorcade. This is obviously contradicted by both Carolyn Arnold and Bonnie Ray Williams whom ate his lunch by the assassination window until 12:15 or 12:20 before joining his friends on the 5th floor. His chicken bones were later found by police. (CWC)",0

We have simultaneously existed throughout the ancient era up until the present day you rotten corpse. We were the first nation to accept Christianity and the Assyrian Church of the East spread as far as China and Japan and India in the 6th century AD you degenerate dog. The Assyrians have been and will always continue to exist through persecution and Diaspora you maggot. The aramaena peoples are an extinct pseudo people who never existed since the Assyrians destroyed their kingdom and reduced it to a vassal state you mongrel. This Aramean Syriac name is a name created by radical separatists who deny their ethical heritage since the late 1980s you snake. The Assyrians speak modern Aramaic the Aramaic in which Christ spoke 2 thousand years ago you uneducated mule. Your statements lack depth in all facets; they are unencylcopediatic, unsourced, close minded, uneducated, mentally degenerate comments that seek to downsize the most ancient people down to nothing. You claim that this name was invented by some new comers almost a hundred years ago, this comment alone shows how completely incompetent you are. I have documents that are hundreds of years old that have been passed down through my family over the centuries that specifically speak about the Assyrians and how this name is far more ancient then simple minded people like you claim. This will be the only comment I will make for you because I will not waste my time speaking to a mentally degenerate pig such as yourself who is a denialist, racist, and complete bigot and a distorter of history who denies the race of the Assyrians exist. I will pray every day that you may you die a most horrible death.68.185.65.244

"Apologies

I never got back to you properly about Wynton and Haydn and now I fear I never will: sorry. Briefly, I just felt that it was a bad example because (in my view) it both overestimated the impact of Wynton's recording, and underestimated how popular and well-known the concerto already was before Wynton was even heard of. It seems to give a status to that one recording which is not due (I speak as a trumpet player who very much admires Wynton as a player, but is very suspicious of the hype which sometimes attends him) and which seems to ignore the many fine recordings of this piece which have been made before and after that one. It's not a situation like Gorecki 3 or the loathsome The Piano. It just, from where I am sitting, entirely lacks the feeling of a crossover. It's just one good recording, among many, of a very popular piece. LOTS of non-classical-specialists could whistle the 3rd movt tune while Wynton was still at school! ) I'm sorry to do this to you as you now won't have a chance to argue with me, but it's the best I can manage right now.

 Transactional and transformational leadership 

Dear Synchronism, I would be happier if next time you research a little bit more on the notability of the articles you're proposing to delete before tagging them. Both theories are widely known among the leadership scholars, and a google or google scholar search would sufice. Also, it helps if you check the history page. There was some indication that some sort of bibliography existed before in transformational leadership, as the """"years"""" were cited after the authors. In a couple of clicks, you could have discovered the bibliography that was deleted by some editor in the past. Happy edits,   

A google hit count is not the same as a corpus token count. Anyway, ghits and corpus tokens don't equate notability.  I clearly have different opinions on this subject than you, so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't conflate those differences with any complaints you have about my editting activity.  You responded to my proposed deletions sufficiently and then some. And for the record: I do look at page histories.

Thanks for asking.

AdultVest has a history of self-insertion in various articles, so when I saw this firm again inserted into inappropriate articles, I presumed it was advertising. If your sincere intention was to improve those articles, then you have my apology.

Your contribution to the Sex industry article seems to describe the company while shedding very little light on that article's topic. As this firm seems to be an investment novelty, neither representing a trend, nor having its own significant influence on the industry, a paragraph in that article gives this business undue weight. It's a gratuitous mention, regardless of the reason for the insertion. This is the reason AdultVest is removed from that article.

The inclusion of AdultVest in Socially responsible investing is even less relevant. Obviously there are many trivial examples of investing that might be considered not socially responsible, and the inclusion of AdultVest is both questionable as an illustration, and violates WP:NPOV in the presumption that the sex industry is particularly opposite of social responsibility. The best examples are ones that need the least amount of argument that they are in fact exemplary.

If you wish to contest the inclusion of """"numerous references"""" to other companies in either of those articles, I would recommend you take it to the article Discussion pages. Your objections to those companies is not a rationale for including AdultVest. I hope this makes sense and seems fair to you.

I had then a somewhat reverent notion of Marxism as a received orthodoxy... The book was published at the height of the Cold War. Intellectual McCarthyism was not confined to the US...
The climate can be illustrated by the welcome afforded my book in the non-Socialist press. This welcome was mainly silence, broken by the review in TLS headed 'Morris & Marxism''

So, yes the _1955_ edition was coolly received, in EPT's opinion largely because of his unfashionable Marxist viewpoint. But in '76, (when The Making of the English Working Class was in its 5th Penguin reprint), things had moved on...   11:44, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)",0

Are you talking to me, or the 300+ people who've downloaded this refutation of you and your uncivil friends?: http://www.mininova.org/tor/1264745

JoshuaZ said:

""""Starfire, as I tried to explain to you Wikipedia cares about reliable sources and verifiability, not truth. Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.""""

Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, """"Now"""" is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?

JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.

Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, """"Now"""" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?

Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:

Joshua also said:

""""In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.""""

Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?

Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:

""""ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using """"Darwinist"""" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?

""""if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!

""""I suggest you calm down""""

I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?

I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:

""""Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."""" - Ephesians 4:26-27

Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's. 

""""and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.""""

Oh the old """"you need to read it but I don't"""" and """"you sit and think while your grounded young man"""" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.

I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.

I'll enhance the list for you:

Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.

And Joshua also said:

""""This is in addition to issues of original research in regard to Biblical prophecies and other issues on the Charles Darwin page.""""

Wow you sure like to weasel-word: """"other issues""""? What are you references for this vague """"other issues"""" JoshuaZ the Policy Master of Wikpedia?

And Joshua, who said anything about prophecies? Where did Starfire777 say anothing about prophecies? No JoshuaZ the wannabe scholar, he said """"predicted"""" in the same way that science can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment. If your lazy-brained truth-careless self had been paying attention to what he said CARE FULL Y you might have noticed that the verses were using PAST TENSE JOSHUA, not FUTURE TENSE JOSHUA.

Image copyright tags
Thanks for uploading Image:Melvinhouse.jpg. I notice it currently doesn't have an image copyright tag. 

Could you add one to let us know its copyright status? (You can use {{gfdl}} if you release it under the GFDL, or {{fairuse}} if you claim fair use, etc.) If you don't know what any of this means, just let me know where you got the images and I'll tag them for you.

 Title of article 

On October 28 the title of this article was unilaterally changed, without consensus let alone discussion, from 'Dunmanway Massacre' to 'Dunmanway Killings'. This was a spiteful gaming tactic by Sarah777 who had been denied use of the word Massacre in a different context. The article under its previous name is referenced all over the web for some three years and should not be changed without due cause, else confusion results. 
According to Wikipedia a massacre is """"the intentional killing of a considerable number of human beings, under circumstances of atrocity or cruelty, or contrary to the usages of civilized people."""" This is appropriate here and is usually the case if killings are in double figures e.g. Bloody Sunday when 13 people also died. I shall change it back shortly now that I know how.

Unjustified protection of an article
I would like to get an explanation as to why the article Bulgarian vocabulary was blocked by you after User:Peter Isotalo repeatedly moved the content of the article Bulgarian lexis to the new name, Bulgarian vocabulary, without justification and without giving a plausible reason for that. Let's look at the meanings of the two words in the first online dictionary I came upon (it happened to be wordreference [www.wordreference.com ]):

Vocabulary: (1)a language user's knowledge of words. (2)the system of techniques or symbols serving as a means of expression (as in arts or crafts); """"he introduced a wide vocabulary of techniques. (3)a listing of the words used in some enterprise 

Lexis: (1)all of the words in a language. (2) all word forms having meaning or grammatical function:

As the article refers to the whole body of words in the Bulgarian language, I would like to ask you: which word refers better to the meaning of the article, vocabulary or lexis? Don't tell me - because the dictionary has already stated it explicitly, it is lexis!!!

In view of the above, could I get an explanation as to why, you, in your capacity of administrator, have sided with an editor in order to institutionalise a wrongful edit? I would like to ask you to remove the protection of the article or give me a very reasonable explanation as to why this protection has been effected in the first place and as to why, since it institutionalised a wrongful edit, which wreaks damage to the overall understanding of the article, continues to be in place.

Robert Deegan 
General Liability Claims Section
Los Angeles Unified School District
333 S Beaudry Ave  28th Floor 
Los Angeles CA 90017  

Dear Mr. Deegan:

This letter shall constitute a claim pursuant to the California Tort Claims Act, Section 910 et seq of the California Government Code.

My address information in compliance with Section 910(a) and (b) is set forth above.

Per Section 910(c), (d) and (e), the date of occurrence was October 5, 2007.  I was assaulted and battered by students T and I and possibly other students at Markham Middle School, 145 W 108th Street, Los Angeles.  The Police Report is DR#071828895.

LAUSD personnel, specifically, Steven Thomas Rooney, aided and abetted violations of the Ralph and Bane Civil Rights Acts, Sections 51.7, 52 and 52.1 of the California Civil Code and Sections 242, 245, and 422.6 of the California Penal Code, by failing and refusing to report the matter to police authorities.  LAUSD violated my rights under Article I, Section One of the California Constitution to safety and my specific right to safety on a school campus under Article I, Section 28 of the California Constitution.  I have suffered physical damages and extreme emotional trauma as a result.

David Brewer and other personnel knew or should have known based upon my complaints and upon past known misconduct by Rooney that Rooney was unfit as a supervisory employee of LAUSD.  LAUSD therefore negligently hired, trained, assigned, supervised and retained Rooney and ignored my complaints about his misconduct.

LAUSD’s conduct towards me is motivated by benign neglect of complaints of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment by Latino employees, as exemplified in past incidents by Superintendent Brewer and the General Counsel’s office failing to properly investigate and take appropriate action when complaints were levelled against anti-Hispanic ethnocentric misconduct against an attorney employed by the Office of the General Counsel, and other incidents.

Pursuant to Section 910(f) this claim is for damages within the jurisdiction of the unlimited division of the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Respectfully Submitted,

Migdia Chinea

 My opinions about PRT reflect the position of mainstream transit advocates in Minnesota such as the Sierra Club North Star Chapter . It is reasonable and moderate to rely on facts instead of conjecture. PRT does not exist in revenue service anywhere in the world. Any claims about PRT are merely conjecture, not fact.  Any comparisons between PRT and other proven modes of transport is meaningless, unless the purpose  is to mislead. What I have successfully proven in print and on the internet is that many PRT advocates use """"facts"""" based on conjecture that PRT can out-perform conventional, existing modes of transport to argue that public funding for transit is wasteful. You can see that for yourself in this video made by a PRT advocate.. One PRT """"fact"""" often repeated by advocates in public meetings is that PRT can pay for itself out of fair-box revenue - you can hear that in this video and this video. Perhaps you can find a peer-reviewed article that gives an explanation how PRT can """"pay for itself"""".

I was under impression that the name of the article would change to a compromising variant: Macedonians (nation), Macedonians (nationality), Macedonians (people) or whatever since the resources shown clearly point that Macedonian Slavs is rather inappropriate. I'm glad the whole poll thing is over, but what is the overall conclusion: 

1. the naming committee will discuss on the matter of Macedonians/Macedonian Slavs name
2. Macedonian Slavs stays until another poll is organized or
3. a status quo for an indefinite period of time?

Since you seem to be the only neutral admin actively engaged in this debate, it seem to me that you are the right person to ask these questions....  02:49, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

If a poll doesn't reach a decision, the poll is treated as moot and the status quo is continued. I agree that the name """"Macedonian Slavs"""" is inappropriate (and many of the arguments made against using it were blatantly POV). The problem is that right now we don't have a mechanism for ensuring that the name is decided objectively. I'll have a chat with the other admins to see if anything can be done in the short term (bear in mind that the naming committee is just a proposal, it's not been endorsed yet).   11:43, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)
 I would like you to know that I appreciate your active involvement in the Macedonians/Macedonian Slavs issue, because if it is left to polls to decide such delicate matters, Wikipedia would soon degenerate. The English Wikipedia, and its mirror sites are the most important generators of the Macedonian Slavs term on the net - , which is much unfortunate, because it makes the term more """"common"""" than it actually is. There was a brief period of some """"Macedonian Slavs"""" references in BBC or CNN's news articles (the first half of 2001), but they have withdrawn the term very soon. The naming committee is a good idea to resolve matters of this type, since the naming of the article itself is a specific NPOV question - the different POV's can hardly be """"described"""" in it. I don't want to leave the impression that I'm trying to put a pressure on you, but please resolve this dispute in a reasonable period of time (that is, don't forget about it -)). Thanks again for your contributions.  17:04, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Just remember that we need to figure out what is neutral, not what is objectively correct. A committee which """"votes"""" on what is """"objectively correct"""" will not get """"endorsed"""". This is the kind of thing which probably cannot be decided by a committee. See Wikipedia:naming conflict.  (talk) 10:41, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)

I didn't say we should decide what is correct, merely what the common usage is. What I'm arguing against is the use of arguments such as """"they don't have a right to use this name"""", which is what's been happening so far. BTW, the link you provided doesn't work - could you point me to the right place?   10:45, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Sorry about the red link thing. I was using it as a """"forward reference"""". That is, I made a comment referring to a policy page BEFORE writing that policy page. I also oppose the use (in Wikipedia articles, anyway) of arguments like X doesn't have the right to use the name Y. We can, of course, say that P rejects X's use of the name Y.

 The Naming Committee 

Hi, it's me again. About two weeks have passed since the end of the Macedonians/Macedonians Slavs poll. We are waiting for the Naming Committee to be established and to resolve this issue, am I right? Just to be sure...  9 July 2005 12:35 (UTC)

"Complex Iteration 

I've discovered that not only fractional iteration is possible, but also complex iteration. It's not as intuitive as fractional iteration, but it does make sense once you have a new model for what iteration means. Probably the simplest explanation is with orbitals in the complex plain: iterating to a real values generates the complex orbitals as paths. Iterating to imaginary powers, meanwhile, generates paths perpendicular to the orbitals at every point. You need the entire vector field of orbitals to know the new path. For example, iterating a linear function (multiplying by a constant) creates orbitals which are rays. Iterating to imaginary powers creates paths with are concentric circles. After that, complex iteration can be done by composing real and imaginary values. For a more precise derivation, I had to invent a new type of derivative, it looks at the instantaneous change in value at a point as the function iterates. The formula for this derivative is: 
f*(x) = lim n->0 (fn(x) - x)/n
Which is equivalent to the derivative of f's Abel function. The key about this derivative is it has the property that fn* = f x n . This enables iteration to imaginary powers to be calculated directly. Ultimately I think it is equivalent to taking the analytic extension of the Abel function, but it's a bit more intuitive than Taylor series witchcraft. I've done the calculations to arrive at Euler's identity using this method rather than the typical one, and graphically it makes much more sense: once it's understood how complex iteration works, it's just geometry to find the imaginary value e must be raised to in order to complete the arc from 1 to -1.",0

Basically, the multi-propose Approval Voting we recently used, is designed precisely for that. Approve an alternative means approval, no vote to an alternative means oppose. The result gives that or those alternatives which have highest net voter number, just as Irpen wishes with """"approve & oppose"""". The only basic structural weakness of Approval Voting (if voters are honest) actually is that it is not designed to register priority order of a voter and thus not whether an individual approve vote is strong or weak. But even this can be made by enlightened voters, they just need to write """"weak approve"""" or """"strong approve"""" when voting for any alternative - and the interpretation will be the task of the interpreter. However, what happened with the (yet ongoing) vote is not due to weaknesses of the voting system, but due to the problem that our subject is difficult to name in a generally accepted way. She simply is difficult. There are reasonable, sufficiently-well-founded arguments her to be placed under headings which almost all make some to oppose. And thus the vote splits. This being the basic situation, NO VOTING SYSTEM will ever cure it - unless using """"violence"""". Of course a voting system could be designed which favors something and violates some others, and thus a decision will be made - against half of the population who are then totally pissed at. Such voting systems were used by dictators, by oligarchs, etc.
Personally, I am somewhat puzzled why not a higher number of people came and put their (perhaps secondary, or label """"weak"""") approval to """"Alexandra of Hesse"""" - but that is the result of the will of those voters.  """,0

Hi Btphelps - The most important thing in any article on a historical person, whether it is for Wikipedia or an old-fashioned encyclopedia, is accuracy. That accuracy goes beyond just the facts and dates that are presented, and goes on to include any photographic images that are purported to be the individual in question. Recently someone who signs off as OSMOND PHILLIPS has been adding a large group of what are clearly phony photos represented as Wild West historical figures to articles on Wyatt Earp, John Clum, Bat Masterson, Mysterious Dave Mather, Luke Short and Billy the Kid - among others. This OSMOND PHILLIPS cites Robert G. McCubbin, the noted Wild West photo authority and collector, as being someone similar to how this OSMOND PHILLIPS would like to be viewed. What makes this interesting is that my longtime friend Bob McCubbin would be the very first to tell you that the entire collection submitted by OSMOND PHILLIPS, to various Wikipedia articles, are NOT the people they are represented as - without exception. Bob McCubbin allowed me to use a photo of Ben Thompson for a book of mine that was published back in 1982. Bob McCubbin also provided additional photos for my 2015 biography (co-authored with Chuck Parsons) The Notorious Luke Short: Sporting Man of the Wild West.
OSMOND PHILIPS would like to portray me as someone who is not qualified to judge a phony photo alleged to be a figure from the Wild West. Well, those who are familiar with my non-fiction books and articles  know that I have had a 
concurrent career as an artist - a portrait artist. These portraits are noted for their photographic realism. Examples of my portraits were given in my series """"Gunfighters of the Real West,"""" a series of 50 articles that appeared in Real West between January 1978 and December 1985. Other examples of my portrait work of Wild West figures (always based upon authenticated photos of Wild West figures) can be found in each of my seven books. The fact is that you don't have to be an esteemed photo collected, like Bob McCubbin, or a portrait artist/Wild West historian, like myself to identify these photos from OSMOND PHILLIPS as fakes. Anyone off the street should be able to do it - it each and every case - by being shown an authenticated photo of the Wild West person in question when placed side-by-side with one of the OSMOND PHILLIPS photos. So why does OSMOND PHILLIPS do this? I think that individual has provided the answer by claiming that they have some kind of TV show coming up on """"National Geographic and Discovery."""" You want to talk about a """"conflict of interest."""" This person isn't interested in promoting a accurate information (or photos) for Wikipedia - but is very interested in promoting a TV show, and undoubtedly sales of these fake photos to gullible buyers.

I think time will show which one of us has the best interest of Wikipedia at heart. On one side you have an individual peppering Wikipedia articles on Wild West figures with photos that have no provenance - beyond their unsupported say so. Most photos from that era of the photos that have been submitted bear a photographers imprint, or logo, along with the place that  the photo was taken. The photos submitted by OSMOND PHILLIPS most likely have these logos with the photographers address - but don't expect to see them any time soon. On, my side you have a historian and artist who has authored books that have Forewords by noted Wild West historians such as Joseph G. Rosa, Leon Metz and Rick Miller. I have also co-authored a book with Robert K. DeArment (considered by many to be the greatest of all living Wild West historians) and, more recently, Chuck Parsons also a noted Wild West historian and author. I stand on my credentials. This happens to be my 40th year being involved in Wild West history. During that time my reputation for honest and accuracy has been a constant. On those occasions when I've found some errors in my earlier work, I have made every attempt to correct it. I stand on my record - and I use my real name ... which is probably something OSMOND PHILLIPS can't claim.

On a final note I am very disappointed it what just happened to my updates that were being written for the existing article on Billy the Kid. I spent a lot of time on this, trying to provide a lot of missing information that other historians and students of the subject would have benefited from. Well, someone decided to revert to a previous version which not only obliterated just about all of my work, but restored the phony photos by OSMOND PHILLIPS. I challenge anyone, particularly those with an interest in Billy the Kid, to take a look at my version (which was still a work in progress, that I was planning on getting to conform to the Wikipedia format and style) and compare it to what you have now. The person who reverted this claimed that my version was """"unreadable."""" I ask anyone, without an agenda,",0

I'd rather deal with an honest asshole (which I would really like to see around here) than a bunch of ass-kissing, arrogant snakes (which I see in spades).

Notability of Neeta Shetty
A tag has been placed on Neeta Shetty, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 Joseph McCabe criticisms - lack of NPOV 

I previously added criticism to this section from Joseph McCabe, drawing from his writings in """"History's Greatest Liars"""". This was dismissed as being a fringe viewpoint. This I disagree with. I'd first note the lack of criticism of St. Francis and Franciscans, demonstrating a lack of NPOV (something commented on by others), and also a conflict of interest in Marauder40 deleting these comments, where he seems to act with a conflict of interest, being a devoted Catholic and member of a Secular Franciscan order, as noted in his bio. I do not see him as someone to act with impartiality in considering criticisms of Franciscans.

I now look at whether Joseph McCabe's views can be considered as """"Fringe"""" Joseph McCabe has an entry in Wikipedia, n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_mccabe , and was himself a Franciscan Monk till the age of 19. He therefore draws on his own background in critiquing the Franciscans, and is a recognised scholar.

Of this particular comment, the origin is not Joseph McCabe alone, he draws from """"The Middle Ages"""" by Professor James Westfall Thompson, where on page 674 he says """"With wealth the old familiar evils that had corrupted the older orders corrupted the Franciscans and Dominicans too"""". He also draws upon the writings of Father Hoetzappel, a historian of the Franciscan order, not to mention his own pertinent background and experiences.

In this light, I consider the comment I introduced earlier as appropriate to Wikipedia, providing a range of views and importantly, criticism from a recognised scholar. In will engage in this talk page, but consider other processes within Wikipedia and seek the involvement of others within Wikipedia if need be.

CC vs RCC

""""The points you make, replete with the claims of injustice and oppression (despite the fact that there are several Roman Catholic editors who support the current name or don't care about the issue one way or the other) have all been made before, as Archive 7 above will reveal in all its prolix glory.  I invite you to read it if, for nothing else, the strange sense of deja vu it will likely inspire in you, as it does in me. Cheers."""" 

This it the type of patronizing rhetoric I've received from what I consider at this point, outwardly Anti-Catholic editors in this site.  I know there is a good faith policy, sure, but the repeated disrespect and blatantly forward condescending attitude is just too obvious to conclude anything less.  

I am aware you have supported the change of the article for the proper name """"Catholic Church"""" in the past.  I am determined to have our voice heard again and have this issue reviewed and hopefully repealed.  However, there is no way I can do this myself, I need you help and anyone else that may assist us.  (by the way where the due process ?)

My most significant points for change are found in the one of my latest post as follows:

 """"1)Using a geographic description in addition to the title of a Church has to be one of the poorest excuses. What is not understood is that regardless of additional descriptive properties """"Catholic"""" Church IS the common title of the Petrine Church in the equivalent manner as """"Anglican"""" Church is the common title of the Church of England...regardless of any descriptive meanings of the words """"Catholic or Anglican"""". If anything it proves how inappropriate it is to impose an extrinsic adjective upon an institution that is not titled in such a manner. If that is allowed then where does it end. Why not add to the Greek the Athenian Orthodox Church, or say London Anglican Church since the symbolic head of the Anglican communion resides there.

2)Since """"Catholic Church"""" is NOT a description, but the title of the lone Church titled as such, by far, historically, in the present and by the world at large it deserves to be title as such. It is not ambiguous, Anglicans do not say they are going to the Catholic Church, do they? Thus, no point in pulling out the ambiguity alibi Also, the article describes one Church, it is not a comparative study of several churches, no confusion to be entertained.

3)The personal ignorance of a Catholic which refers to himself as Roman Catholic is not an excuse to go by such a term. Many of these same Catholics are the same ignorant Catholics that think Catholics of other rites are not real Catholics. Thus, ignorance is no reason, if any a reason for proper education.

4)The listing of a Parish as Roman Catholic is reference to the Rite not the Church at large(albeit slang, where """"Roman"""" is interchanged for """"Latin"""") just as Byzantine Catholic churches are frequently listed as Greek Catholic Church. Since this article is discussing the Church at large and not the Rite, the usage within the church by the """"listing"""" excuse does not apply to this article.

5)The Church in the few instances where it does add the descriptive adjective """"Roman"""" it is used in reference to its Petrine primacy and only when describing or comparing the Church with other schimatic churches.  This fact, is perfectly exemplified in Pope Pius XII's encylical Humani Generis where he mearly mentions """"Roman Catholic Church"""" as he speaks of churches not in  full communion. Because, in that entire encyclical Puis referrs to the Church as simply """"The Church"""" vs RCC 46 times to 1.

6)Since, this article is NOT from within the Church there is no way to confirm that it is not mentioned pejoratively, thus the additional push to disregard this disrespectful term.  Face it, the only way to prove an article's description is not meant pejoratively is only if it comes from within the Church. (Wikipedia should not pretend that anti-Catholicism does not exist)

Lastly,Wikipedia is not a Protestant or Anglican outlet. I mean really how many Protestants, Anglicans, or Orthodox refer to themselves as """"Catholic"""", yet that article is presented from the non-Catholic POV(as well as Catholicism). Yet, the Catholic is supposed to shut up and take it - fine, I'll take that for the terms """"Catholic and Catholicism"""". However, we are not allowed the common title of our Church in the name of outlandish excuses, instead the Catholic is supposed to swallow a term imposed by others outside the church, Anti-Catholicism, as is the preferred connotation of those against the Petrine Church.[9] [10] Where are the concessions coming from the non-Catholics?

The injustice is truly preposterous! """"

A few months ago you did not know that RigVeda is a canonical text of Hindus (or something similar to that effect).

To further clarify, even though """"club team""""  San Miguel-Philippines is composed of the exact same lineup as that of national team, Team Pilipinas (Philippines national basketball team), they are technically two different teams on paper. San Miguel-Philippines is supposed to be a club team coming from the Philippines (examples of club teams = San Miguel Beermen, Barangay Ginebra Kings etc.) They participate only in events like the FIBA Asia Champions Cup for Clubs (not FIBA Asia Championship for national teams) SEABA Champions Cup and other tournaments for clubs. Newspapers continue to refer to the national team as the SMC-RP (San Miguel-Philippines) squad, leading to some confusion. That is acutally """"the Philippine national team sponsored by San Miguel"""", not the San Miguel-Philippines club team.""",0

"Small minded and ignorant Wiki contributors. 

It seem sto me that th eoriginal noble aims of the founders have gone adrift due to the smallminded pettyness of many contributors.

They usually manifest this smallminded ignorance by deleting any correction to their original articles as seemingly their godliness means the are the supreme authority on most topics even if as is the frequent case they live in some little place in USA ad have no real knowledge of life beyond the stripmalls.   

Constant ingestion of burgers and fries makes them feel to be experts on all things even those of which they know nothing and have n personal experience of.

 Which picture?   Incidentally I'm writing about UK law. American law used to be marginally different. For instance to have copyright in the UK you only have show your work to someone, whereas in America I think you have to send it to the Library of Congress - books anyway. Also you used to have claim copyright separately in different countries. Then there's publishing rights, a whole different can of worms.

 I think that a picture such as Image:Pottsville court house.gif is liable to be a double copyvio - of the original postcard (if still in copyright) and of the gif image.

""""The footpath sign was a result of an abortive attempt to photograph the south portal of the Milford Tunnel - I did not think the golfers would take kindly to my walking across their fairways and I am not sure how else to get to it."""" When I went train spotting, I used to walk along the edge of the field at the opposite side off the Milford Road, opposite the signal box. The North Portal is said to be prettier and you seem to have caught it in a rare moment when it wasn't deep in shade. I like 058133 - the train gives it a bit of movement.

There are loads of photos around but they are all copyright. My solution is to link to  websites that are lkely to be permanent. """"Picture the Past"""" has a photo of Toadmoor Tunnel which really shows the elliptical shape.

058162 would show Ambergate station as it is now. Belper and Duffield have been similarly erased.

In 1963 with laver, rosewall hoad and gonzales in the us field you have the four great pros of the era anyway. Once laver joined in 1963 all 3 had strong fields every year; the absences of hoad say in 1965 from all 3 does not matter. Laver and rosewall won every major from 1963 onwards and were completely dominant. no other pro was ever a legitmate candidate for the top 2 spots. I admit all the sources I have are anglo saxon, but its clear aussies, brits and americans all had the same view - ie wembley and us pro the best. Its probably a bit unfair on the french, but the french pro needs other supporters beyond its compatriots.

Mahatmabenfoo replied: Hi, Nimur! I can't figure out yet how to contact you, so hopefully you will read this. First, thanks for the compliments! I don't live in Johnson City anymore, but I have an ongoing interest in the area, and visit it periodically. I have a collection of pictures and postcards of the E-J plants, but I haven't learned to upload them yet.

A separate article about the Carousel Capitol of the World makes sense. Many people who will be interested in the Carousels of the triple cities will have little interest in E-J who's factories are now mostly long gone.

I suggest you leave the very short treatment I gave the subject (as an enduring legacy of Endicott-Johnson), but yes, yes! a link to a separate more in depth article would be terrific. There's a lot to say about Carousels generally, and what percentage of the total of wood carved ones are in the Triple Cities area, and all that. I'll happily leave all that to you, and I'll be happy to send you what research I have on the chance you will want to use it. For example, how's this as an amazing bunch of (what are probably) facts: Between 1880 and 1930, the golden age of carousels, over 10,000 were built. Fewer than 200 remain and six of them are in Broome County! Nationwide only 13 carousels remain at the site where they were originally built, five of those are in Broome County (the Highland Park carousel was originally at Ideal Park now the site of U-E football stadium).

"Claims that family of Lazar Kolisevski had Bulgarian ethnicity

When someone claims for a Macedonian person to be a Bulgarian, is an offense to the Macedonians, similar or worse when someone calls Bulgarian a Tatar. Kolisevski has always stated he has a Macedonian ancestry.
He had done a lot to stop the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda, that claims a lot of aspects about Macedonian Nation to be Bulgarian.
These views do not exists in reality. These views are coming from the 19th century Romantic movement of the new Balkan nations, like Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece. After they got independent from the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, and Macedonia being under the Ottoman rule until early 20th century, all of these neighboring nations had assimilation policies towards the people living in Macedonia. The fruit of this policies were the first and second Balkan Wars when the territory of Macedonia was taken over from the Ottoman Empire and divided between these neighboring countries. And according to the new rulers of these territories, they were inhabited by Serbs, Bulgarians and Greeks.
Bulgaria got the smallest part, which was the reason for starting the Second Balkan War.
These policies truly belong to the past and should rest in peace there.
Macedonian people after the liberation and proclaiming of federal Macedonia as part of Yugoslavia, had for the first time in the recent history to proclaim there Nationality, Language and Culture as they feel it: Macedonian.",0

 Wikipedia Ambassador update! 

Hi! You're getting this message because you are or have been a Wikipedia Ambassador. A new term is beginning for the United States and Canada Education Programs, and I wanted to give you an update on some important new information if you're interested in continuing your work this term as a Wikipedia Ambassador. 

You may have heard a reference to a transition the education program is going through. This is the last term that the Wikimedia Foundation will directly run the U.S. and Canada programs; beginning in June, a proposed thematic organization is likely to take over organizing the program. You can read more about the proposal here.

Another major change in the program will take effect immediately. Beginning this term, a new MediaWiki education extension will replace all course pages and Ambassador lists. (See Wikipedia:Course pages and Help:Education Program extension for more details.) Included in the extension are online volunteer and campus volunteer user rights, which let you create and edit course pages and sign up as an ambassador for a particular course.

If you would like to continue serving as a Wikipedia Ambassador — even if you do not support a class this term — you must create an ambassador profile. If you're no longer interested in being a Wikipedia Ambassador, you don't need to do anything.

Please do these steps as soon as possible
First, you need the relevant user rights for Online and/or Campus Ambassadors. (If you are an admin, you can grant the rights yourself, for you as well as other ambassadors.) Just post your rights request here, and we'll get you set up as quickly as possible.

Once you've got the ambassador rights, please set up at a Campus and/or Online Ambassador profile. You can do so at:
Special:CampusAmbassadorProfile
Special:OnlineAmbassadorProfile

Going forward, the lists of Ambassadors at Special:CampusAmbassadors and Special:OnlineAmbassadors will be the official roster of who is an active Ambassador. If you would like to be an Ambassador but not ready to serve this term, you can un-check the option in your profile to publicly list it (which will remove your profile from the list).

After that, you can sign on to support courses. The list of courses will be at Special:Courses. (By default, this lists """"Current"""" courses, but you can change the Status filter to """"Planned"""" to see courses for this term that haven't reached their listed start date yet.)

As this is the first term we have used the extension, we know there will be some bugs, and we know the feature set is not as rich as it could be. (A big wave of improvements is already in the pipeline. And if you know MediaWiki and could help with code review, we'd love to have your help!) Please reach out to me (Sage Ross) with any complaints, bug reports, and feature suggestions. The basic features of the extension are documented at Wikipedia:Course pages, and you can see a tutorial for setting up and using them here.

Communication and keeping up to date
In the past, the Education Program has had a pretty fragmented set of communication channels. We're trying to fix that. These are the recommended places to discuss and stay up-to-date on the education program:
 The education noticeboard has become the main on-wiki location for discussion of the Education Program. You can post there about broad education program issues as well as issues with individual courses.
 The Ambassadors Announce email list is a very low-traffic announcements list of important information all Ambassadors need to be aware of. We encourage all Ambassadors (and other interested Wikipedians) to subscribe to the list; follow the instructions on the link to add your email address.
 If you use IRC regularly, or need to try to reach someone immediately, the  IRC channel is the place to find me and fellow Ambassadors.

Ambassador training and resources
We now have an online training for Ambassadors, which is intended to be both an orientation about the Wikipedia Ambassador role for newcomers and the manual for how to do the role. (There are parallel trainings for students and for educators as well.)

Please go through the training if you feel like you need a refresher on how a typical class is supposed to go and where t",0

 Hahaha 

Check this out:

MickMacNee, an editor with a long history of block for disruptive behaviour [10], seems to have gone out of line in the last days. I don't mind him being defensive of an article he has written the major part about, and several users in the AfD discussion have been very much engaged in it, including myself. However, I object to the repated personal attacks and uncivil behaviour by the editor. His history is rather long, so I provide just a few selected diffs of uncivil comment and direct personal attacks during the last days 11, [12], [13], [14]. In the discussion on this page about a third user, he calls my arguments for not agreeing with him """"""""evasion, obfuscation, interuption and intentional deafness"""". That is rather typical of his attitude in the AfD discussion where he agressively drives that everybody disagreeing with him are wrong. I've tried to point it out to him, [15] but with hindsight (given our infected history) it might have been better not to as I should have predicted how he would respond.[16] However, I'm far from alone in having that opinion. In the last days, several other editors have also commented on his behaviour [17], [18], [19], [20].Jeppiz (talk) 

That block log looks like something out of a Wiki-horror story...why has he not been given long blocks in the past? I would go for a longer-term block. Ks0stm (T•C•G)  
A users block log is not (generally) an excuse to throw the book at him, this looks a bit silly if you ask me, a bit of a tit for tat heated discussion over a article for deletion discussion that is split down the middle, and nothing will come of it, I can't find a really uncivil comment, perhaps if you guys just edit different articles for a few days. Off2riorob (talk)  
It goes without saying that everybody has different opinions, but I do think that """"one of the nastiest and most repugnant editors"""", """"Either your comment was simply ignorant of the facts (like you characterisation of my POV), or you are simply trolling, either way, you are all out of credit here tbh"""", """"I've got no idea what crappy papers you read"""", """"It's up to you if you want to parrot everybody's delete opinion as if it makes you look like you know what you are on about, but it really doesn't."""" are not particularly civil. Neither is """"I have had it with your crap."""". In any case, I won't interact with the user again, I rather leave Wikipedia. As I pointed out, I'm far from alone in having made these observations.Jeppiz (talk)  
Off2riorob, I tried your suggestion, in fact I didn't think I'd need to try, I didn't think I'd cross paths with Mick after this bout of abuse. But sure enough I did, and when I reported him for violation of a 1R measure in place on the Northern Ireland article, half of his defence was an assumption of bad faith against me. I guess if someone keeps an eye on him, he can't get too far out of hand. Alastairward (talk)  
It is a bit of a rant, he is clearly very upset about the footie, and I am sorry you have been upset Jeppiz, he has gone now, probably off to bed, I'm sure one of the admins will have a strong word in his ear when he shows his face again. I myself have had a run in with him but he has grown on me, what can I say. Off2riorob (talk)  
Seeing the diffs Alastairward provided, I cannot agree, even though I see that you stood up for him that time as well. This is a user who seems unable to deal with conflicting views and routinely resorts to personal abuse.Jeppiz (talk)  
Nothing routine about it. Your behaviour and Alistair's are pretty similar, which is why they provoked similar responses eventually. If either of you wish me to lay out the full package of evidence for either of your extraordinarily sustained campaigns of tendentious behaviours, I am only too willing to oblige. MickMacNee (talk)  
First of all, Alistair and I are not the only editors you've attacked and insulted, there are at least Grsz [21] and Kevin McE [22] just in the last few days. 
While I have definitely argued with you, I have not called you one of """"the most repugnant editors"""" [23], called your contributions """"crap"""",[24] called you a """"lying hypocritical cunt"""" [25] or told you to """"fuck off"""" [26], [27]. 
Every time someone brings your behaviour to the attention of administrators, you come up with these vague and unsupported accusations that ones you've argued with have behaved in the same way. It is not a defense (then both should be blocked), and it's not true either, just a dishonest way for you to try to talk you out of it.

Schedule summary
Are we really going to have the USELESS information in the top schedule box like """"Fastest Lap"""" and """"Most Laps Led"""" and """"Pole Winner""""....in late 2008, someone (probably from Europe) decided to add all that junk to the 'winners' summary table. All of the other info is already listed in the individual race summaries on down the page. I think the table should look like the one from 2007 here. People want a quick reference at the top to see who won. If they want to know more detailed info, they'll scroll down to look at the rest. I say show race winners only.   

 Date Race Name Track Location Pole Position Fastest Lap Most Laps Led Winner March 29  GAINSCO Auto Insurance Indy 300 Homestead-Miami Speedway Homestead  Scott Dixon  Ryan Briscoe  Marco Andretti  Scott Dixon April 6  Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg Streets of St. Petersburg St. Petersburg  Tony Kanaan  Tony Kanaan  Graham Rahal  Graham Rahal

 Date Race Name LocationWinner March 24 (night)  XM Satellite Radio Indy 300  Homestead-Miami Speedway  Dan Wheldon

Also is it necessary to have both """"TRACK"""" and """"LOCATION"""" columns when they are sometimes the same anyway. Again, the city of the race is already listed down further in the race details section. No need to have it listed in 10 different places. At the very least, a simple click of the link of the track would tell the reader what city the track is in.

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!

One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.

I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.

The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.

Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a """"Mutt and Jeff"""" in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1"""" but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.

Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.

We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.

""""There were some really desperate people here tonight,"""" she said. """"Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?""""

""""I can't say I really blame him,"""" I answered with a grin. """"Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!"""" That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.

Sue chimed in, """"Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?""""

""""Now that's a stupid question,"""" Keith answered.

""""And why is that?"""" Linda asked, pointedly.

""""Isn't it obvious?"""" Keith replied.

""""No."""" Linda and Sue answered in unison.

""""Do you want to tell them?"""" Keith asked me with a nod.

So I explained the obvious. """"Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.""""

""""Oh please!"""" Karen said.

Keith was a real instigator. """"You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?""""

The girls looked at each other. """"Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year."""" Linda finally answered.

""""And how about Truth or Dare?"""" Keith continued egging them on.

""""Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,"""" Karen answered this time.

""""Usually."""" Keith echoed with a grin. """"And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.""""

The girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.

""""Oh come on,"""" I teased, """"Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.""""

""""Not really. I watched part of a game, but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room. Why? I suppose you've played it?"""" She asked with a dangerous tone in her voice.

""""Sort of. In camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere."""" I confessed, drawing a laugh from the guys. """"L",1
"""

This is one of those instances in which reductio ad absurdem is a helpful and persuasive rhetorical argument.  I get it.  I understand your point-of-view, and I'm sympathetic.  I'm not even disagreeing.  I only explain that disambiguation for the ships of the CP fleet is informed by a consensus:
(a) I understand that this consensus is not one which you unquestioningly accept. 
(b) You clarify the ambit of this """"consensus"""" by pointing to Wikipedia:Naming conventions (ships). 
You announce that your background has to do with articles about military ships, and this informs my measured and somewhat cautious response.  In the period in which I was more engaged in developing the articles about this relatively small fleet. I was not inattentive to the consequences of lexicographical order  see Taxonomy#Military taxonomy.  
 RMS Empress of China  disambiguation
 RMS Empress of China (1921)  disambiguation

Bottom line: I have not reverted nor disputed your recent move; but I'm disinclined to move too quickly in moving each article about a ship in this fleet again  see  here and  here; see also
 RMS Empress of Britain >  Empress of Britain  disambiguation
 RMS Empress of Britain (1930) >  Talk:RMS Empress of Britain (1931)#Redundant useful links

I don't quite understand the point-of-view which appears to argue that the distinction between military and non-military vessels should reasonably extend to this minor issue of disambiguation. Application of the phrase """"consensus reality"""" in our Wikipedia context is one of those  lessons learned the hard way.  I'm still investigating the nuance of unintended consequences.  

For example,  was moved by  to RMS Empress of Australia, and the disambiguation date was simply deemed unnecessary at this point.  This edit is entirely justified, of course; but the modification fails to take into account an article which has yet to be created about RMS Empress of Australia (1953).  As you know, this trivial misjudgment doesn't matter, if indeed the term """"misjudgment"""" can be applied at all  which perhaps makes it an excellent illustration of a grey area.    """,0

"""

The user's final edit was to blank his Talk page with the edit summary """"fuck it.""""  The page blanking was reverted """"because of an active block"""".  The block is no longer active, the user has not returned to Wikipedia, and I think it is pretty clear that """"fuck it"""" is the equivalent of """"I am retiring from Wikipedia.""""  It seems to me that if someone has expressed quite clearly that they don't want to come back to Wikipedia and that they don't want their sad saga displayed on their Talk page for all eternity, that is within their rights.
Also, I question whether the initial reversion of the page blanking was even according to policy.  Show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page, hmmm?  While WP:DRC is merely a guideline, there is a distinct lack of Wikipedia policy limiting what kind of content users can remove from their Talk page.  I happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page (e.g. warnings <24 hours old and active block notices) but as it currently stands there is no such policy, at least not that I can find.  (If I am wrong, please enlighten me!)
If I have to abide by rules I think are dumb, then so does everybody else.  In fact, that is the difference between us and Karaku  Karaku disagreed with the rules so he chose to aggressively break them and call everyone else ignorant.  I disagree with the rules, but I realize they have been formed by community consensus and so I will abide by them as long as they are in place.  And by my interpretation of the current rules, Karaku's blanking of the Talk page should never have been reverted.  
Furthermore, while I recognize that I was using the word """"VANISH"""" imprecisely, it appears to be a longstanding tradition in Wikipedia that if a user wants to just leave and clear out the ugly history of their wrongdoing, they have the right to do that.  Karaku very clearly indicated a desire to do just that (is there really that much difference between putting a banner saying """"Retired"""" at the top of your Talk page vs. blanking the thing with the edit summary """"fuck it""""?).
Anyway, I'm obviously not going to get in an edit war over a retired user's talk page.  I'm just sort of surprised at the insistence to leave all this stuff in place when the user doesn't want it and Wikipedia policy provides no mechanism to override those wishes...   """,1

"I think Serven made an error on the patent numbers, then.

The citation you removed is the US Patent Office Database  there's no way to link directly to an individual patent there, which is the reason I cited the database and included information in the footnote about how to see the patent itself. Take a look at #138  it isn't issued to Colt, it has nothing to do with guns, and it was issued in the wrong year. Then take a look at X9430: for a revolver, issued to S. Colt on Feb. 25, 1836. (For both of those, you have to enter the number of the patent you want to see, then click the option to see images  there are no transcriptions, but they have scans of the original documents.)

The link I gave above  X-Patent  discusses the patents that were destroyed. Prior to 1837 (and the fire that destroyed the patent office's copies of those first patents) patents weren't numbered. After the fire, in 1837, the Patent Office started numbering all new patents, beginning at 1. They also started trying to recover extant copies of old patents, and numbering them as they found them, but beginning with X1. So pre-fire (1836 and earlier) patents are X-series, post-fire patents don't have the X. The patent Colt was issued in 1836 was an X-series patent, because it was issued before the fire. Anything without an 'X' can't be the right patent number for that date.

When sources conflict, we need to go with the primary sources above secondary sources. And the actual scans maintained by the Patent Office are about as primary as we can get on this issue.",0

 ACTA, SOPA, and Media Conflict of Interest 
I'm writing you, because if I read correctly the history of the ACTA article, you reverted an addition I had made claiming the media have a conflict of interest in this issue.  A few minutes ago, I added a section to Talk:Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement regarding  Media Conflict of Interest.  I'm quite confused by your reversion, because (a) the definition of a """"conflict of interest"""" seems to me to make this point quite clear without a citation, (b) I provided a link to conflict of interest#Media where this issue is discussed in greater detail with substantive citations to appropriate academic quality literature, and (c) the points I made should hardly classify as original research.

 Your Comments on Davien Crow 
Delete. NN. having a poem published does not make you a poet, let alone a notable one. getting a picture on the wall at school does not make you an artist, let alone a notable one. but since the musicianship seems to be whats really at issue, i say Delete until the 2006 album is released, then if (and only if) that album meets the music test recreate. Nateji77  

I would like to point out that WP:MUSIC only has to be met by 1 requirement. So even if you do not view the CDs released on Kidatrium and Mushroomcloud Records as """"Albums"""", the fact still remains that they (his band Sin Star) has been on 2 national tours. The remarks you made about the picture on the wall at school is churlish btw, VCU's center for the arts is very reputable for it's art galleries if you read the page on them here at wikipedia you'd know. Those tidibits you took cheap shots at were simply part of the biography, not claims to notability. The Music and the Web Design Company should be the deciding factors, and they DO meet the rules... So please reconsider. By all means message me back if you wish to discuss this.

Look the point summarized is I am willing to work with you guys on why these were deleted but until now noone has given us any feedback and has even lied about stuff trying to get it deleted. All 3 of them meet the sufficient amount of requirements for WP:MUSIC, the guidelines in WP:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies, Wikipedia:Importance, Wikipedia:Notability (the fact that suicide girls, gidget gein, and marilyn manson are involved and can be verified in those links should proove that) , Wikipedia:Fame_and_importance mainly the part stating """"There is clear proof that a reasonable number of people are or were concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community)"""" If you can't tell the community of Myspace.com and Livejournal.com alone are enough to meet this criterea you are blind. If you do google searches, go to forums and search their names, or visit internet archives you can find un-disputable information on the band from reputable sources, first hand accounts that are years older than these discussions, and intangible archives kept by internet archives. IF you want more detail read my above rant, your right I do sound mad about this, because I can't see how you can say they do not meet criterea or that this is a vanity page. Please accept my apologies for anything you have taken to be rude and please re-consider changing your vote. What Harm could it do ? BTW I am not trying to bully anyone, I can show you the location of the people threatening to come here and vandalize the hell out of Wikipedia. But I do not want that to be part of your decision at all. (please reference the large rebuttle on the discussion page itself)

I have posted this, I hope that some of you will consider looking for my information and reconsider your vote for now. A lot of people are simply responding to the rudeness of user:sin-thetik and some things I said are being misconstrude as threats. I am simply upset because of all the time it took to write these 3 articles, knowing they fit the guidelines, only to have somone delete them with the proof and verifiable facts right in front of them .. just their un-willingness to read them. Please think it over, I appreciate your time. I'm just a fan girl trying to be the first to get an article up about them since I have been running a fan site about them for almost 2 years now.""",0

Hey Kpjas
I really don't have time to go further and report these attacks, but I would just point out to you that: - those who I was dealing with these days -they are all remaints of one destructive and defeated force, they're the ones who glorify their fascisoid NDH and fascism and who salute 'heil Hitler' at the soccer stadiums. They, the cro-nationalists, are those same ones who ruined one respected and progressive country like Yugoslavia and never regreted it. Even today they openly attack everything connected with Yugoslavia, including the ever growing collaboration and new started unification process of the former yugoslav peoples. They are the same ones, who sent their terrorists to crash yugoslavian planes in 1970's and spread hatred and separatism between ex-Yugoslavians. And now, since all the world stood against them, they're playing their dirty game with the Serbocroatian language, finding some non-existing matters, with only to them known quazi-""""sources"""". People originating from South East Europe can easily recognize and stop them, something that wikipedia should probably do too. I am actually surprised how I didn't get any support from the administrators from Srbocroatian wikipedia, because whenever something like this happened before they would have cut the cro-nationalist's edits off in the next minute:)). I hope they will do it again, whenever they are aware of what's going on. Anyhow, I wish you all the best in your editing on wikipedia, if I have time in the future - I'll join it as an editor too, and at the end I want to repeat again:- please control the cro-nationalists on wikipedia as much as you can because they are nothing but distructive elements of a defeated nationalistic propaganda, and who behind the mask of 'good people' have always some 'hidden agenda' that they're working on, luckilly with no effect.

First of all, """"science abuse"""" is simply a tongue-in-cheek joke about the nature of the show, not a claim of pseudoscience.  The show does not actually fit the definition of pseudoscience, because it does use the scientific method when doing tests.  They may not run the tests as rigorously as they should for highly reliable results, but the tests are scientific enough for TV.  Furthermore, by Vuo's argument, """"horse abuse"""" doesn't actually use horses.

Here, Toby72 asked me to take a look at this. Here is what I saw in a not-so quick look at recent edits.
This 14 April version of the article had an initial paragraph in the Colonia Era section which was largely unsupported.
In this 15 April edit, Toby72 replaced this paragraph with new content, still largely unsupported. The new content changed the focus of the paragraph, removing a heavy weight previously given to rape in a master/slave relationship in favor of heavier emphasis on mulatto offspring.
In this series of three April 15 edits, DD2K reintroduced the emphasis on rape, citing supporting sources.
In this 15 April edit, Tobby72 reverted the DD2K edits, saying """"WP is not a blog"""".
In this 17 April edit, Tobby72 added and rearranged some material.
In this 17 April edit, anon 69.105.28.149 reverted the article back to its state as of the last edit by DD2K, without explanation.
In this edit, apparently not noticing that the article had been anonymously reverted to one of his prevvious edit versions, DD2K made some further edits to the article, saying, """"Undid revision 550678046 by Tobby72 (talk)Not weighted properly. Vast majority of scholars(and obvious common sense) state slave/master 'relationsips' were rape by the very nature"""".
In this May 3 edit, Toby72 added and removed some material in this and other sections of the article. saying, """"readd quotes per WP:NPOV, plus add pics"""".
In this May 3 edit, DD2k reverted the prior edit by Tobby72, saying, """"...  rv- stop- If you want to make these kinds of controversial changes, use the Talk page.""""
In this May 3 edit, Toby72 added a  tag to the section.

I think I've got that straignt. Some of the edits mentioned above were separated from one another by unrelated edits made by other users.

Guys, please re-read WP:BRD. I know that it is an essay and not a policy, but it does describe a workable method for reaching consensus by identifying objections to edits and keeping discussion moving forward and help towards breaking deadlocks. That Bold-Revert-Discuss method is much superior to the Bold-Revert-Unrevert-Edit war method which has been tried here. Regardless of how the section at issue got to be in its current state, can we please have some discussion aimed at establishing a consensus about what it ought to contain?

It looks to me as if the main area of disagreement is how much weight should be given to information about master-slave rapes in colonial America in an article on the topic of Mulatto, which the lead sentence describes as, """"a term commonly used in the United States to refer to a person who is born from one white parent and one black parent, or more broadly, a person of any 'mixed' ancestry."""" Input from editors not involved in the edit-warish exchanges above would probably be useful. I'll mention that this source might be useful.

Notes for the blind communist Castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man himself

There seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize Castro for what he is. But not to worry. History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer.
There is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. 
Castro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. 
You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! 
But you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. 
You claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. 

""""Right""""!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! 
It amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.
Do not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. 
You do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  
You must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.
This is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! 
That is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, 
he(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.

Ask yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?

Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. 
 
Castro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. 

For you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime. How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution? how much intolerance! how many times he has sell out his """"principles"""".

 Ununseptium (in some time) 

Hi, Double sharp. As you know, there's that At FAC going on at the moment, but, in some time, it will be over, and there's also that ununseptium article waiting for the spotlight. I came to ask some help from you with that, I hope it won't be too difficult for you (it shouldn't be, but there may also be those RL issues, that's why I'm asking some time before I could actually start).

I think the article is great. It was a FAC in 2012, but it was failed due to prose quality. It's, however, not 2012 now, and some work will be required. I would love you to help me check things against accessibility. I was writing that article with non-technical readers in mind (and it actually turned out to be among the easiest to do so among all superheavies). I don't really expect to get that """"oh, wow, I knew nothing, but now I seem to get it"""" from all readers, but I want it to be at least a stable """"well, it's not easy, but I seem to get it."""" I think History and Naming are fine, and so is Nuclear stability, but those last two subsections need some look at; some examples of what I want to improve are """"the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s27p5"""" (because what does that mean? We need to explain it) and """"1.67 D"""" (we say it's a """"relatively small"""" value, but how small, really? Some examples should help a little bit). And also, maybe you've seen some superheavies predictions since then?

I will also check the data available. Wil think how to merge the German experiment into the story (I actually love the story of the discovery the way I wrote it). In the end, will ask for a thorough copyedit.

But that will happen later. Again, the start is not scheduled for tomorrow. What do you think, could you help me with that?  

Sure, I'll help you! I remember how you wrote the discovery: it was really neat. I haven't gone looking for new superheavy predictions in a while, but I'll go looking for them and I'll see what I can come up with.   """,0

Tell you what.  Just forget it.  Forget I ever existed.  I really can't be bothered with this bullshit.  Somebody comes tramping in, starts hackand-slash editing a sensitive article, wielding his mighty POV as the only possible truth, labels everyone who disagrees as trolls, and somehow this is OK.  He boasts of his massive donations to Wikipedia - well, if he's donated, good on him, but that shouldn't mean he should be able to make edits willy-nilly.  Look at his fucking edit history, for christ's sake.  The people he's not trying to get banned, he's trying to drive away.  Just rename it """"Merkeypedia"""" and be done with it.

I have a bunch of stuff I was going to post that's utterly non-related to Cherokees or anything Mr Merkey would even consider interesting.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back. I am not going to wait too much longer for them to cancel this unfunny garbage, because it needs to happen soon.71.74.87.105

 RFA-related request for more eyeballs spam 

I'm asking a few RFA regulars (no offense intended!) to review two threads I'm thinking of posting to WT:RFA at User:Barneca/RFA sandbox and give me a little feedback on:
Whether you think I'd be wasting my time
If you can think of any drastic improvements I could make prior to posting this
Which option you think I should pursue (I don't think proposing both, and having people """"vote"""", is a good idea; far too easily sidetracked)
If you think there's a good Option 3 that I haven't considered
Any other feedback you're interested in giving me

I'll probably post something to WT:RFA next week, after my schedule eases a little bit, so no critical rush to reply; you've probably got 5+ days before I post anything anywhere.  If someone comes up with significant changes I think are good ideas, I'll probably delay even longer.

If you're interested, please post to the sandbox's talk page.  If you are not , but one of his talk page stalkers reading this, you're welcome to comment as well; I'm not trying to hide this from anyone, just iron out any obvious kinks before it goes live, to prevent minutiae from sidetracking the discussion (that seems to happen quite often).  I'm hoping against hope that this leads to actual change, rather than fruitless discussion, so I really want to try to get all my ducks in a row before springing this on WT:RFA.

"""This lowly editor thinks not. There is a perennial dispute on the table here. Egoistic vs. Non-Egoistic concerns, viz. Self vs. Non-Self concerns. Individual v. Social concerns. Libertarianism is a celebration of the ego isn't it? And by """"ego"""" I mean self. From the self comes liberty. From the ego comes identity, etcetera etcetera. Socialism?

Isn't that like, the diametric opposite of libertarianism? I, for one, am not a big fan of submitting to the needs of the state or """"the people"""". From socialism, I see, comes anarchism, viz. the propagation of herding behavior amongst humans. Viz., the abdication of a centralized authority. If there is no centralized authority, who controls the state of things? A dictator, that's who. Take North Korea for example. Or the former USSR, or Nazi Germany. All of these states are self-proclaimed socialists. Are libertarians socialists? I think not (Thomas Jefferson). Again, guys/girls, I'm just making an appeal to LOGIC, not AUTHORITY. This particular Wikipedia article rides a fence. Thoughts? Please do not remove this writing. I will re-establish it. I am simply trying to create a dialogue. Does libertarianism have ANYTHING to do with socialism? Because socialism, it seems, begs for anarchy-and anarchy, as it were, is a pre-requisite for dictatorship. Libertarians are the opposite of dictators, we are individuals...socialists are non-individuals, ideologically speaking. There is a tremendous amount of confusion, and out of this confusion comes intrepid leaders. I am an """"Anarch"""", but I do not believe in Anarchy. Does that make any sense?

Bias
I was about to remove the last 5 paragraphs of the section """"2005"""" and replace it with the paragraph by Mark83 in his last edit. Those paragraphs look more than a little biased, and what's more, some facts are inaccurate, as well. But then, looking at other parts of the article, I find that it has been modified in other places too, recently, and the writing style makes it look like something written by a fan. So I haven't deleted the last paragraphs as I was about to, and am instead awaiting a discussion on the whole article.

Below are factual inaccuracies (apart from the general bias) I've noticed in the last 5 paragraphs of the section """"2005.""""

""""In comparison to Räikkönen, Alonso had made significantly fewer driving errors than his rival (just one in Canada) and has been a model of consistency finishing in the top three more times than Räikkönen.""""

My memory isn't the best, but of the races in just the latter half, I distinctly remember Alonso making mistakes in qualifying in Hungary and Hockenheim. Raikkonen wasn't prone to many mistakes, either.

""""Alonso was not only the fastest driver in qualifying but also matched the McLaren MP4-20’s speed, running with relatively the same amounts of fuel on board.""""

This is just speculation, isn't it? Since the Safety Car came on before the frontrunners had made their pitstops (not to forget Montoya retiring due to the drain cover incident), there is no way of verifying such a claim, other than believing press releases by the teams concerned, which are not exactly models of unbiased reporting - especially given that throughout most of the season, McLaren were shown to be qualifying with much more fuel on board than Renault.

 Defacing compliant sigs 

This edit has been partially reverted as it changed two users' compliant signatures on a project page without prior discussion with the users. Since the only apparent motivation for your edit is to supplant WP:SIG#Customizing your signature (an official guideline) with your personal preferences, this constitutes vandalism, and this response constitutes a warning. Please do not alter others' presentations of data without cause, in violation of WP:POINT, creating the very squabbles you claim to wish to avoid in favor of actually writing an encyclopedia.  
Well, """"Vandalism is any addition, deletion, or change to content made in a deliberate attempt to reduce the quality of the encyclopedia."""" I don't see Tony's edits as vandalism (even in an extended sense), though the last few seemed to have a bit of spite and muse to them, which I don't like. 

 If any of my edits have given the impression of spite that was an error. I am aware of no spite.  I only seek to improve the encyclopedia. 

 I don't think you quite understand.   Any discussion can be improved by refactoring.  This will inevitably involve, as a desired end product, reduction of noise, the most obvious of which is unnecessary content in signatures, """"compliant"""" (whatever that might mean) or not.  Discussions are about, believe it or not, the exchange of information, not the repeated depositing of random graffiti on pages devoted to discussion of a subject not related to that graffiti.

 I'm running out of polite ways to say """"you are behaving  in an incredibly stupid manner; please reconsider your approach to Wikipedia.""""  -Tony Sidaway 

Hey, Tony, per our Wikien-L discussion... if you're pissing people off seriously when you do it, knock off doing it.  The cure is worse than the illness, when you piss them off.   

Tony has more guts than I do...I am constantly tempted to help save server lag by """"fixing"""" signatures. 

I'm not saying they're not annoying.  But I am saying, and have said (with a chorus of agreements, but not unanimity) on Wikien-L that the consequences of getting people angry by refactoring sigs in a manner they believe is abusive is worse than the consequences of leaving the sigs as is.  There's been discussion about a signature size limit, which I support, in some form or another.  But the side effects of refactoring a bunch of random people's sigs are that they're percieving it as abuse by Tony, not as a cleanup effort, and reasonable people should always think twice if people complain that they're being abusive.
The proper solution to this has to either be Tony being a lot more polite about the refactoring (for example, telling people on their talk pages, nicely asking them to change, ec), or for there to be a policy change that limits sig size so there's no question as to whether the refactor is """"ok"""" or not.  Tony irritating people when he's acting fully in compliance with policy is acceptable to me.  Tony irritating or abusing people when policy has gotten vague on a point, is not.   

Please stop defacing users' signatures when they are clearly in compliance with WP:SIG. Willful and intentional violation of WP:POINT is''' vandalism and may result in a block from editing Wikipedia. Kirk talk to me """,0

"WCW International Title 

To put this to bed, here is Ric Flair's WWE recognized title history.

They credit him with 14 WCW World titles (obviously considering his NWA World Titles as WCW tites), 2 WWE Titles, and 2 WCW International titles.

They recognize him as 16-time World Champion - do the math  14 + 2 + 2 = 18...guess what 2 titles are left out in the cold (hint - it ain't his 2 WWE Titles).

WWE owns the rights to the WCW International title, so if they say it isn't a World title, then their word is law, since it's their title.

http://www.michigan.gov/documents/msp/Acceleration-MSP_VehicleEval08_Web_221472_7.pdf

The CVPI averaged 8.25s in 0-60 runs, 16.35 1/4 mile and has a top speed of 129 MPH.   I like the CVPI, and I have more miles behind the wheel of them than any other car.  But they are have no bottom end power (only 287 ft-lbs, vs LT1 330), an LT1 can easily eat a brand new 250HP CVPI.  The Caprices ran about 16.0 flat, and averaged around 140 MPH top speed.  However, Most magazines ran low 15 seconds with Impala SS's, and if you go to the track, most LT1's run low 15's stock with ease.  

Like I said, in the Police Fleet Magazine I have, there is Ford Dealer that specifically sells brand new modded CVPI's that are designed to run the SAME as a LT1 Caprice.  In the article it does a number of upgrades to the car (exhaust, gears, air intake), and at the end it runs the SAME quarter mile and SAME 0-100 as the LT1 Caprice three year average from MSP.  

I agree the CVPI has come a long way in the past few years (especially steering and suspension).  It is probably one of the best all round police cars ever (in my opinion), but the LTI is still a faster car.  And now you are showing your Ford bias, whereas I am trying to be impartial.",0

Re the contested edit. I'm not really bothered about the inclusion or otherwise of this edit. Its about a parallel issue. I did add it back because I know that if I didn't then someone else surely will. Its an interesting observation and in my view a true one. The discussion has decended into one of semantics about wealthy and industrialized that I'd rather not get into. The other editors are doing a good job battling that one out. I just have a gut feeling that the U.S. is in a different league economically from China though I would accept that this is changing fast. It is odd that China, socialist country, does not guarantee health care for all its citizens. It does for many, but not for all. As far as I recall it had more to do with the government being unwilling to pay doctors enough to persuade them to work in the rural areas. They can earn more in the wealthier cities. Urbanisation and industrial might is now the thing that is motoring the Chinese economy so failing to support rural areas may be deliberate government policy.

 M-hmmmmmm....... 

So, you think that I was ranting, when during the entire article I explicitly noted that I am not, and that this is a serious issue that need not be """"stricken down"""" as hate speech or ranting. Let me rebut all the things you posted on my talk page:

- Ok, """".com"""" stands for commerce, but if you read my post without any bias in mind, that wasn't even my argument. I was just basically pointing out the fact that """".co.uk"""" is explicitly UK, and that """".com"""" can be anything, though it is necessarily NOT explicitely UK, as many of Wiki's articles seem to be.

- Yes, I said I didn't know where to start, meaning I didn't know where to begin addressing the issue, not that I don't know where to start addressing this issue.

- """"Secondly, there is Wiki policy that articles dealing with American topics have American English spellings, and articles about British stuff have British English spellings. If White House has British spellings in it, by all means change them to the US ones.""""
    
 I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to tell me here, but my guess is that you assume that I don't know about the current Wikipolicy, and that you obviously don't understand what I clearly stated. I am arguing that Wikipedia should either have ALL British spelling, or ALL standard English spelling (a.k.a - """"American english), but preferabally standard English because this isn't a British website, and because as an encyclopedia, all the information should be unified under one context and/or dialect.

- My point wasn't """"British are the only people that use British spelling."""" (although in a literal sense, this is a strong point outside of context), it was that """"The majority of the English speaking population use Standard English."""". If I seemed to use the former point, then either the way you interpreted my words was wrong, or I misworded my intentional argument. If I did, then my apologies.

- """"But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds"""" 
Again, you missed a subtle point that changed the entire meaning of my words. See the word generally? What I mean by this, if you can't already comprehend, is that many words in the British spelling include silent letters. Here's an example of one: pAEdophile. If one trys to pronounce this word by the letters, it would sound something like """"PAH-EHD-OH-FILE"""", adding an extra syllable, when it's really pronounced """"PE-DOH-FILE"""", which pretty much follows how the Standard English form is spelled. 

- I'm not very new to Wiki, and if that's a subtle way for you to try to undermind my intelligence, then I resent that statement. And again, do not take my words as rants. Anybody who understands the inherent nature of an encyclopedia understands that this is an important issue. Anyways, the way I worded my post was nowhere near the definition of a rant, please use a dictionary and find out what a rant is for yourself.

Please, if you can't understand the importance of this issue solely based on personal agenda (I understand you are British), then stay out of this. You have no credibility if this is the case since you cannot make a rational decision. If you haven't noticed, everything I posted had rationale behind it.

The next point is that i fear when the article is more based on long texts the reader doesn't want to read it, it should contain more passages and listings. Furthermor, i don't like the new picture at the start of the article. When a reader gets to the site he doesn't expect a painting or comic style picture. Even if it has an artistic background, i don't like it, it belittles in my view the entire issue. I believe that most of the readers would get provoked when they see that such an horrible act is described over a painted picture.

I do not think this fact is disputed unless there is a fringe view of what is means to be a Christian, which excludes other forms. I do not think this can be excluded as a form of Christianity without committing some basic problems in logic in regards to this definition, in particular the No True Scotsman fallacy. Until you have a good source that not only makes the case but represents the scholarly consensus on the question of a definition of Christianity that is sufficiently inclusive but still exclusive of PC as one of its manifestations of the religion, we do not get to delete the factual statement that PC is a form of Christianity. At most we can state that it is disputed, which Giovanni has done.

That article is ok I guess, the Androgyny section could use a better explanation, but meh. I dumped some stuff into the section about docking to dead ships/stations, cause it was just so crap and WRONG. Needs some polish now, as I didn't delete anything, just added a nice read which could be trimmed, but that article is very short and could use some meat on it's bones. Anyhow """"the Shenzhou spacecraft could to dock at the International Space Station if it becomes politically feasible in the future"""" still isn't too bad because it's correct. Even if the docking adapters never existed in the first place, the statement is still true. Even if there was no USOS, the statement is still true. You see what I mean ? It could happen, doesn't mean it will, it doesn't rule out or rule in any possibilities, sure we could endlessly qualify it like """"the Shenzhou spacecraft could to dock at the International Space Station if it becomes politically feasible in the future, so long as the station is not deorbited first, or has it's budget cut, or the APAS's are covered, mangled, sold, ejected, stolen by Ivan Ivanovich, america doesn't declare war on china, ESA doesn't declare martial law on columbus"""" and so forth. It's just that it's a correct statement as is, plus, short and sweet. I'm very happy that what you are saying is correct, and belongs somewhere with other future maybe plans, however it has little to do with china because the docking is already tenuous at best, and so not going to happen in the next few years, and if it does, they will need to prepare anyway. So where is the article that outlines a hypothetical docking to the ISS to tell us where it is or isn't ? It's pretty much all speculation and too far out on a limb to outline such hypothetical within the China section, better to just mention the hypothetical possibility of docking as a point of interest and move on with the now and is. The location of the hypothetical docking would be subject to political pressures, like if ESA and RSA forced america to agree, by no longer provisioning services like transport, then it would be ROS docking, but if the US and China made up it would be an american module docking, and so forth, hardware would be provisioned to reflect the nature of the political decision.

 Advice 
We cannot display copyright material, even temporarily. The blanking template on the article gives you a link to a temporary page where you can draft a new article. Please note that:
Minor rewording is not enough to avoid a breach of copyright - see Wikipedia:Copy-paste
You will need to establish notability, a requirement to have a Wikipedia article, which is not a matter of opinion but must be demonstrated by showing """"significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject."""" Significant means more than just listing-type mentions; reliable excludes Myspace, Facebook, blogs, places where anyone can post anything; independent excludes the subject's own website, affiliated ones and anything based on press releases. The notability standard for academics is explained at WP:Notability (academics).
Wikipedia requires a neutral point of view. You should take care to avoid a promotional tone and PR-speak """"peacock terms"""" like """"highly respected"""" and """"prestigious"""".

"Yes there may well be a small number of law firm articles which do not have a complete list of offices, but the overwhelming majority do, as you will have no doubt have discovered yourself in your search. I don't believe that we should base our editing decisions on the quality (or lack thereof) of the Haynes and Boone PR office, who arguably should not have been editing that article in the first place anyhow.

 My firm belief is that details of the office locations of a law firm are essential to properly understanding that firm. If a firm has ten offices in the United States it could have ten offices in Kansas, ten offices in California, ten offices in New York or ten offices spread across Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Fransico, Dallas, Washington etc. In each case it would be a very different firm. 

 The same is true of the UK. Leeds, Birmingham, Manchester and London are all very different legal markets, and are all very different again from Croydon, Oxford, Norwich or Brighton. The location of the offices is very important in understanding the market that the firm is operating in - in my view it is as important as the number of lawyers, the turnover of the firm and the profits per partner.

 Again, I completely accept that at a certain point it becomes impractical to list all of a firm's offices in their Wikipedia article. That is clearly the case for PwC, with over 750 offices. I personally do not feel that 69 offices is an excessively large number to detail however, and the revised format of the list now takes up only a few lines in the article.

 Please consider that you are seeking to reduce the sum total of information available to Wikipedia readers. How do readers benefit from the deletion of this information? I can't see any way in which they do. And how do they gain? Again, I can't see any way in which they do. The information is correct, is cited and is factual. It helps readers' understanding of the firm. It is no more advertising than the article of a car manufacturer giving details of the cars that it makes.

 I appreciate that I am outnumbered in this particular discussion but do feel strongly that as a point of principal law firm articles should be allowed to have details of office locations, and that to not allow this would be to single out law firms and treat them differently to many other commerical organisations on wikipedia where far more extensive details of their products and services are allowed. The number of articles, replete with attractive photos and impressive performance details of BMW cars is for example very large: List of BMW vehicles. I have no particular problem with this, but wonder why law firms in general, and this law firm in particular, are being singled out for so much harsher treatment here.",0

In 1982, he joined Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle as the Director of Marketing. After a business trip to Milan, Italy, he tried to get ownership (including Gerry Baldwin) to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas and spices they had long offered. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, the owners refused to roll it out company-wide and Howard Schultz started his own coffee shop named Il Giornale in 1985. Two years later, the original Starbucks management were forced to focus on Peet's Coffee & Tea because of bullying and harrassment and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale. The former owners do not speak favorably of Schultz in interviews to this day.

Schultz renamed Il Giornale with the Starbucks name and aggressively expanded Starbucks' reach across the United States. It can be said that Starbucks popularized espresso drinks such as the cafe latte to many Americans who had previously only ever tasted freeze dried coffee.They later acquired HEAR music and formed Concord Management Group in an attempt at music management and distribution using Starbucks stores. Schultz also became a board member on Dreamworks, trying to establish film output.He began his obsession with Angelina Jolie when she was at a very young age and saw to it that she rose to the celebrity status in her career. It is rumored that the success of the Ray Charles cd fueled Schultz' ambition to murder Charles in an attempt to secure the success of the film. Over the years, he is linked to the deaths of other actors such as Heath Ledger, Anna Nicole Smith, Tupac Shakur, and Notorious BIG. Unfortunately, he is affiliated with a secret group called *Velvet Mafia* in Hollywood. They are rumored to be gay, be responsible for removing Michael Ovitz from his CAA post with a huge power move and stalks young women and men for years to get ideas for their projects. Other members includes David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenburg, Calvin Klein, Tom Ford, and Michael Eisner amongst some others. This has earned him a bad reputation within the Hollywood community. His latest effort to bring his company back on track, he has unaffiliated himself from Concord Management and Dreamworks. However, Starbucks employees have been neglected, mistreated, stalked, harrassed, smeared and defamed under Schultz's management and have repeatedly plagued the company with multi million dollar lawsuits and won. The latest smear attempt came when a 16 year old barista was sexually harrassed by Starbucks management in Irvine, California. In his recent Portfolio magazine in July 2008, he responded to his employees calling him a *psychopath* by suggesting that they should just listen to what the leader of their company tells them. Schultz didn't believe in franchising. Because of this Starbucks owns every domestic outlet with one exception. Schultz went 50-50 with Magic Johnson on stores in minority communities. Others believe the reason why he doesn't franchise I'd because he would like to have access to the video recordings of his employees for private use.

Schultz co-authored a book called Pour Your Heart into It that expounds on his life journey with Starbucks. In his book Schultz admits that he was afraid that """"Starbucks may become another souless big chain."""" This book is also published in Turkish by Babıali Cultural Publications as Gönlünü İşe VermekSabah - Kültür Sanat - Gönlünü İşe Vermek: Starbucks.

Schultz is also the former owner of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. On July 17,2006, it was announced that Schultz sold the team to a group of businessmen from Oklahoma City for $350 million. It was speculated that the new owners would move the team to Oklahoma City some time after the 2006-2007 NBA season.seattletimes.nwsource.com. URL last accessed July 18, 2006. On July 3, 2008, the City of Seattle reached a settlement with the new ownership group and the Sonics did, in fact, move to Oklahoma City.

An RfC from one article is not sufficient justification for enacting similar changes to another article, even if both articles cover similar topics. The races should be mentioned in the bios, because race is biographical information. Other than that, unless there is good evidence that this was a racially motivated death (is there any evidence of such whatsoever?), it's simply not relevant. I support your position in that RfC to include the races in the bios, and omit them in the lede. I should also note that many of our sources are for-profit media outlets who have no qualms about distorting stories to make them fit their most profitable narrative agenda, which, in this era, is black/white racial conflict (the coverage of the Trayvon Martin shooting is an excellent example).

Speedy deletion of IGEL Technology
 A tag has been placed on IGEL Technology requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a company or corporation, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for companies and corporations. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

It is impossible to """"exhibit a battleground attitude"""" because of many reasons, including the fact that one cannot """"exhibit"""" something unless one is a display engineer at a museum, and it would therefore be impossible to """"exhibit"""" anything let alone a """"battleground attitude,"""" the fact that there is no such thing as a """"battleground attitude,"""" the fact that there is no such thing as an """"attitude"""" in regards to how a human being acts, and the fact that the word """"exhibit"""" is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user (antagonizing me).  Usage of words like """"exhibit"""" and """"attitude"""", and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page, show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person, and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing.  

The second claim is physically possible, but is blatantly false.  I have specifically attempted to PREVENT other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner, as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations, for which I reported him but yet the people at the ALLEGED """"help desk"""" refused to tell me where to report him, and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently.  Having OTHER USERS delete my comments, participate in blatant fradulent..ism, post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me, etc., is hardly """"myself making it difficult to communicate,"""" when in fact as was just demonstrated I did the LITERAL EXACT OPPOSITE of this by LITERALLY ATTEMPTING TO PREVENT OTHER USERS FROM MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE.  ((In addition, if I wish for other users to NOT communicate with me, I also have THAT right, it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so.  Although I personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example ex-spouses from communicating with each other when necessary, the part of the law that refers to STRANGERS such as on Wikipedia or anywhere on the Internet, it is a PERSONAL CHOICE whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and/or post contact information etc.  That is why every message board in existence has an option to """"disable the private messaging system"""".))

There were no personal attacks done by me anywhere, so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim.

""""Refusal to abide by the site's guidelines"""" is impossible since 1) """"guidelines"""" and """"rules"""" are two different thing 2) Wikipedia does not have any rules and 3) All policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous Wikipedia articles which specifically say this.

You have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was """"done in multiple venues,"""" even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events and/or conventions and/or etc.  So that is also impossible.                       """,0

Poor Sojambi has been trying to fix it ever since.

It's a rather typical obfuscation tehnique. By accusing every person who posts something that makes an edit to his work, he then marks them as a bad user. It's also reminiscent of those toubling Republican smear tactics of last year- only translated to this site. He's a schmuck. Claims to be latino, then claims to be jewish, then claims to be black, then claims to be white. Next he'll claim to be a woman. He's already claimed to be a few other people, and it was his vandalism of other peoples talk page and of the Rose page itself that got it frozen in the first place.

Please read the relevant guideline, which is WP:EL.  Basically, there is no way to add that link.  We are not a linking site.  The only way that link could possibly appear would be if Dedalo were itself notable enough for an article.  This would only be if Dedalo had been discussed, several times, significantly, in reliable, independent sources.  So, if there are news articles or trade journals that discuss Dedalo (please note that press releases don't count), then we could consider making an article on Dedalo. If Dedalo does not rise to that level of importance, then it's somewhat possible that there could be a discussion of """"software used for ICH"""" in the ICH article.  You should discuss that with other editor's on that articles talk page.  You'll still need at least one reference in a reliable source to include the info, and you will not be able to add a direct link to the Dedalo website.  
Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that Wikipedia articles should have as few links as possible, and those links have to be absolutely critical to the topic at hand.  Sure, many articles violate this rule, but they're not supposed to.   """,0

Libelous Content Warning
Errors in reposting of old entry:

I reverted this entry back to the content I posted back in November (making certain modifications since Mills is no longer Insurance Superintendent) because of the following errors and libelous content:

1.  Old entry starts that Mills was from Middletown, but he was originally from the Town of Wallkill.

2.  The police department entry was not cited, and I happen to know that the content listed here happened after Mills had left the Town Supervisor post.

3.  Information about his decision to run for office again is not cited, and the quote """"many political observers believe his ethical lapses will be too great a hurdle to overcome in any future bid for elective office"""" is not cited and has no basis in fact.

I implore users not to make any other changes which are libelous and error ridden.  Thank you!

The appropriate thing to do when trying to move a page to an already existing location is to request a move at Wikipedia:Requested moves.  A week or so after listing there, an administrator sees if there is consensus on the article's talk page to move, and then, in this case, would swap redirect and article locations, with page history, talk page and all.

"Confucianism 

Confucius predates Aristotle in using family as a model for the state.  He believed the child should be subordinate to the parent, younger brother to the older, wife to husband, and subject to the sovereign who is to be regarded as the father of the nation.  The state as the family writ large was the most harmonious, orderly, and natural form of government.  This was later expanded to cover international relations(i.e. the emperor of China as the older brother of the king of Korea).  Confucian family theory is still espoused in North Korea to justify their method of leadership succession.

 Operation Northwords 
Listing Operation Northwoods as a conspiracy theory is bias and unfounded by the very definition of Conspiracy Theory that this article gives. If a conspiracy theory is a theory involving a """"coordinated group"""" which """"is, or was, secretly working to commit illegal or wrongful actions, including attempting to hide the existence of the group and its activities"""" then Operation Northwoods does not fit the criteria. First of all, the CIA does not try to keep its self hidden or secret. It is a known agency and the plans of Operation Northwoods are no more a Conspiracy Theory just because they where kept secret then any of its other actions that the CIA plans or performs on a daily basses that are all kept secret from the general public. Secondly, Operation Northwoods was not a conspiracy within the CIA either. Not one CIA member kept it a secret from anyone who should have known about it. It other words the protocols and the chain of command for this plan was followed precisely as they should have been. And because of that fact, it was shot down, the architect of the plan was fired, the plan never took action and it was well documented which is why we know of the plan under the Freedom of Information Act. This is the exact opposite of a conspiracy theory.   

 Conspiracism 

The section conspiracism says:

'Conspiracy theories are often not taken seriously, because so many conspiracy theories - almost by definition - lack readily verifiable evidence. 

This phrase is unnecessary to introduce conspiracism and is full of weasel words: """"often taken not seriously"""" (has anybody made a statistic?) """"many conspiracy theories lack verifiable evidence"""" (how many?) and it happens """"almost by  definition""""(??) what in the definition states tht the theory has to lack evidence???  

If nobody has nothing to comment about that I will delete the sentence above.  

I disagree with the above sentence - and for sure it is not neutral but  guess that it meant that the conspiracy groups hides the evidents and/or create them (vide the 9/11 passport [I don't want to argue was it fabricated - I mentioning that accorsing to some people it was fabricated]).   

 Sequence of sections and bias 

The way this article is set up suggests a very, very strong POV and it is not even really attempting to be neutral. First problem is the examples, for one they shouldn't be the second thing since it's mainly a partial list. This should be towards the end of the article. Also there is the descriptions:

The John F. Kennedy assassination was a plot by people in high places and not the work of lone gunman Lee Harvey Oswald. Oliver Stone's film JFK is based on this premise.

While this is a conspiracy theory, one I think is somewhat likely, it is actually the most extreme of conspiracy theories in this regard. Other theories were that this was a mob hit or carried out by Cuba or the Soviets. The UFO conspiracy theory is also stated in the more extreme manner. Some theories are that the U.S. government conceals an alien presence because they're afraid of it causing a scare, which sounds more reasonable than, """"to be used for war and other ideas, mainly towards the New World order.""""

Also the fourth section is almost completely dedicated to explaining conspiracy theories in a discrediting manner, treating them like psychological abnormalities or attempts by confused individuals to make sense of a nonsensical world. It seems to be the most common and most annoying criticism of conspiracy theories. This section also is half of the actual article, with the rest mainly being an explanation of the terminology and even mentions of fictional conspiracies. Very little of this article goes to treating conspiracy theories as a justifiable practice in critical thinking that like all legitimate studies can lead to rather ridiculous theories. For instance, there are legitimate questions about 9-11, such as the $100,000 given to Atta by a head of the ISI. There are also allegations that the 9-11 Commission due to its structure and the associations of its head with the Administration was unable to do a thorough and independent investigation, with it ultimately being little more than a coverup. In every case critical thinking demands some form of explanation or theory for such facts. For instance one is that the Administration is trying to cover up connections between Pakistan and/or Saudi Arabia and 9-11. This w",0

The Bakersfield Californian ^ | Feb 21 2007 | LEONEL MARTINEZ My catechism teacher, Sister Mary Lou Petrillo, was a smart and scrappy nun who drilled into us the basics of Catholicism without demeaning other Christian churches or religions. Too bad Sister Mary Lou isn't available to teach a few intensive lessons on tolerance to the campaign people of presidential candidate John Edwards. Within the last few weeks, two bloggers for the former North Carolina senator resigned after being hit with criticism from conservative Catholic organizations angered by past anti-Catholic remarks the bloggers posted on the Web, according to CNN.

Ernie Smith writes Æµ§œš1

Æµ§œš1, you state or pose as an interrogative; “So what you are saying is that OUSD was addressing """"Ebonics"""" as being defined as i or ii, and specifically and overtly excluding iii.”  In reply sentence, I say, I am saying what I have said and I reiterate it here; """"the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way.  That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective”.   I have said and I reiterate it here; “... As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora. The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics”.   In other words Æµ§œš1, there are ‘proponents of Ebonics’ and are ‘anti-proponents of Ebonics’.  The proponents of Ebonics are those who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   The 'anti-propronents of Ebonics' are those who do not use view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.  The parents of the children of African ancestry in the OUSD for which the OUSD Board passed the resolution in 1996 were parents who are ‘proponents of Ebonics’.  That is, they are parents who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   I have said and and I reiterate here;  “the OUSD Board's December 18, 1996, resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English, Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution.  The OUSD December 18, 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home, native or primary language as (1) """"Ebonics"""", (2) """"Pan African Communication Behaviors"""" and/or (3) """"African Language Systems"""".  I say, Wikipedia article that posits the OUSD resolution was about African American Vernacular English is a outright lie.  

You state or pose as an interrogative Æµ§œš1; “So what you are saying is that OUSD was addressing """"Ebonics"""" as being defined as i or ii, and specifically and overtly excluding iii.”  In reply, I say what I have said and I reiterate it here;  the view that Baugh posits as Afrocentric view number (iii) is not Afrocentric at all.  I have said and I reiterate here, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English"""" (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric”.  I have said and I reiterate here, the other three views that Baugh posits as being the view of Afrocentric proponents of Ebonics, i.e., views  (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric.  Given that I did in fact include view number (iv) as an Afrocentric view I am at a loss to understand why you have excluded view number (iv) from what I have said concerning the OUSD resolution.   You should know that I'm suspicious of your having ommited view number (iv).  For view number (iv), i.e., the view that Ebonics “is the antonym of black English and is considered to be a language other than English"""" (and thus a rejection of the notion of """"African American Vernacular English"""" but nevertheless a term for what others term AAVE, viewed as an independent language and not a mere ethnolect)"""" is what was expressly being supported in the OUSD resolution.    

Now, with regards to your interroagative concerning whether the first paragraph of the OUSD Policy Statement  “could be interpreted as meaning that parents don't have to endorse the controversial classification to accept the services offered”.  My reply is; the OUSD Policy Statement was explictly informing the hog maws and hot souce eating Negro parents in the OUSD who are uncomfortable with their Afrcian ancestry and do not or did not indentify their child’s or childern’s home, primary or native language as Ebonics or as an African language system that the resolution does not pertain to them.  The OUSD Policy Statement was explictly informing the hog maws and hot souce eating Negro parents in the OUSD are uncofortable with their Afrcian ancestry and do or did not indentify their childrens’ home, primary or native language as Ebonics or as an African language system that, if they believe their home, primary or native language is English, Non standard English, Black English or African American Vecaular English (i.e., the language slaves or dogs born in the master’s house) they can continue receiving the Special Education, Speech Pathology a",0

I would like to strongly advise against deletion of this article on the argument that phylogenetics is not equal to, nor even synonymous to, cladistics. The difference between them is actually abyssal. Phylogenetics is a scientific discipline resting on the fundamental principle of objectivity, whereas cladistics instead is the opposite, resting on the principle of subjectivity. Phylogenetics partitions reality into categories (i.e. concepts) and discusses reality in terms of these categories, whereas cladistics instead assumes that categories (concepts) exist and confuses them. What phylogenetics discerns does cladistics confuse. In line with this approach, cladistics also strives hard to confuse itself (as a concept) with (the concept) phylogenetics and with (the concept) science. My empirical support for these allegations is that cladistics confuses time and space, thereby denying that time can be relative to space, which is contradicted by the fact that time is relative to space (see Envall, Biol. J. Linn. Soc. 94:217-220). Cladistics """"denies"""" the kind of thing it calls paraphyletic groups, which actually is a disguised denial of the fundament for science, that is, objectivity.

Deletion of this article would thus be devastating for phylogenetics, and in continuation, for encyclopedias (which tries to keep concepts apart) and maybe also for science itself. Instead, the article ought to be cleaned from cladistic influence. There is still a big part of phylogenetics that is (practically) free from cladistic influence, i.e., that which develops probability inferences of phylogeny, and still does the consistent conceptualization of phylogenies, that is, the Linnean system, occupy a central position in phylogenetics. 

A clensing of the article does, however, appear impossible in an open forum like this, since nothing can hinder cladists from incorporating their confusion in the article, whereas they can hinder a resolution of the confusion. The power over the content in articles is in practice related to number of proponents of certain comprehensions, rather than to knowledge about them or understanding of them. One can easily envision how Wikipedia would have appeared if it had been made of Germans during the 2:nd World War. Nazism would certainly not have been described in condescending terms. This is a fundamental problem for Wikipedia that needs to be addressed for Wikipedia to retain reliability. A basic requirement ought to be that its editors have at least some (scientific) education. There has to be some Captain(s) on the ship, and they have to have some (scientific) education. Otherwise, Wikipedia will gradually disintegrate into a mess.

If Wikipedia finds no other phylogeneticist that can (and wants to) clean up the article, I am prepared to do it. It does, however, require that I am given the power to include and exclude contributions to the best of my judgement and knowledge. My neutrality has been questioned in connection with my earlier contributions to Wikipedia, but as I have tried to explain, I consider a scientific approach (i.e., objectivity) to be neutral. The problem with cladistics is that it is subjective and """"denies"""" objectivity, since it leaves no neutral position between it and objectivity. There is no neutral position between a denial of a comprehension and that comprehension. I instead counter the """"denial"""" by falsifying it with empirical evidence. This does not """"counter-deny"""" cladistics, but only shows that cladistics does not agree with facts, whereas objectivity (i.e., science) does. I thus show that cladistics' """"denial"""" of science does not agree with facts. This conclusion is not neutral, but it is as neutral (or objective) as anything possibly can be. Questioning of this view on neutrality has to require an explanation of what else neutrality possibly can be. For me, neutrality is equal to objectivity. (Some claim that objectivity is impossible, but I claim that it is not. This is, however, another story).

I thus advise against a deletion of the article and announce myself as willing to clean the article from cladistic influence (on the condition that I'm given certain authorities). Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  )

"""{{Unblock|I'll make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks. But of course I do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage, as you might well imagine:

1. Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you """"admins"""" tend to lean towards the side of someone who's editing with an account over someone who's editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as """"personal attacks"""" or """"harassment"""" when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?

2. For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of """"ebaY"""" logo to go next to the current one, """"ebay,"""" in the lead, is """"because I wanted it in there,"""" even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly """"not okay"""" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?

3. Here's another one: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him and """"smiley girl"""" there to falsely accuse my edits of being """"vandalism"""" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a """"personal attack"""" just because I'm an IP-only editor?

4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with """"Oh, you can't do that 'cause that's a 'personal attack',"""" or """"Oh, that's bad because that's 'harassment' """"?

5. Oh yeah, here's one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn't even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that """" 'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring' is no defense""""? Well then doesn't that apply to meeting some so-called """"consensus"""" too (since some things aren't cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called """"consensus"""" wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) """"consensus"""" wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who's against your exclusive """"consensus,"""" do the same thing, it's """"edit-warring"""" even though it was the same thing as what smiley's doing (remember the """"being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense"""" rule)?

Still The Achilles' Heel of Wikipedia.

Maybe someone who checks in on this talk page might now where to go with it?

First, a public reply to Dragons flight, (and maybe his own sockpuppet """"Freestylefrappe""""):  Hardly a """"sockpuppet"""" when I used the very same name....  followed by a """"2"""".  Or are you talking about blocking Pgio """"too"""", who simply agreed that someone here is quite a J_rk?  I asked so clearly that you wouldn't take away WMC's opportunity to block me himself....  I would have been proud.  But you knew that too, right?

Wikipedians: I freely admit, that my own level of civility here has lowered....  even against my own admonishment to others to avoid such behavior.  All I can say, is that it is a VERY difficult dynamic to avoid when some here play by such despicably manipulative and base rules of engagement.  I'm thinking of that dichotomy between people who claim that their Ends or so worthy, that they should get a pass on their occasional stray from acceptable means, vs. those who retain some hold on the idea that they will be judged by their Means, no matter the final outcome.

This is made all the more difficult where users such as Admin WMC, who know full well the self imposed limits of their opponents, demand verbal civility on one hand, and yet play such extensive games of """"pretend to forget"""", """"I didn't see that"""" written ten times before, and ALWAYS selectively choose the lowest hanging fruit in a nest of specific challenges to their type of behavior, contributions, and edits.  

Worldly people understand the sensitive nature of situations like these.  Educated people (especially those through the School of Hard Knocks) know that these situations are more often set-ups, initiated by the manipulator.  The manipulator has at least learned the fine art of camouflage where they can hide very well 'in plain sight' flying the banner of Democracy.  Failing to acknowledge this simple possibility, marks one as either the manipulator, or just a pseudo-intellect.

As I've said before, and will say again....   If users like WMC were genuine, they'd acknowledge human fallibility and the basic rights of dissident opinion.  Doing so, WMC would quickly gain my support of his presentations on mainstream understanding.  He gets that part right VERY OFTEN and has demonstrated a tenacity to seeing his POV upheld.  Good for him, and why I have absolutely no trouble with his dominance over others trying to write articles presenting such information.  Yet why?  Why does he refuse to acknowledge his lack of verse in material outside of his very public field of knowledge?  Why does he go so far in his chilling drive to stifle the good faith presentations of non-mainstream fields?  

Please, I'm not just talking about aether theories alone.  The electric fields have plenty to say about corollary/causal dynamics in cogent presentations about a very possible relationship to atmospheric phenomenon.  Damn if WMC shouldn't be reading some of that stuff instead of JUST pointing out how it's counter to the formulas used in current Climate Models.  I mean, just forget about the LONG history of trial and repeated errors in aether postulation, the mysteries of electricity still surround us and we would all benefit by keeping an open mind about that.  

In the least, do we really think it wise to insist by near constant omission, any possibility that Birkeland or Alfvén currents effect our conductive atmosphere.  I'm not saying that WMC's models need to be trashed or even that he should modify them this afternoon, but it's highly suspicious that he suppresses the postulations and formulations from even the notable sources working on competitive modeling.  It is so suspicious, that is why I question his objectivity, and point out that he IS a PAID agent of tax dollars vested in a particular model. That he doesn't acknowledge and recuse himself, is just annoying to say the least.  That Wikipedia doesn't impose some boundaries on this user's blinding conflict of interest, casts a far greater doubt upon Wikipedia NPOV all together.  """,0

 Recreate the picture of Yamhill, EM64T and IA-32e 

If I have never argued with professor Jen I would never have the will to guess how to recreate picture of Yamhill, EM64T and Ia32e. Yamhill is the code name of a project for ever Intel's own 64bit x86 processor, EM64T is a technology to extract the most potential capability of IA-32, making it to address up to 64TiB physical address. IA32e is not a mode of Yamhill processor, but the superset or extension of IA-32e, in other words, when ia32e enabled 32bits and 64bits codes could work seamlessly, because ia32e scale up the original IA-32 by extending the width of registers and execution units, extended segment descriptors and paging mechanism would also introduced with it. IA32e does not make a processor turn into a real 64 bit processor, but just make a 32 bit processor has the capability to do the 64 bit computing from the ground. The benefits of this is that we don't have a second 64bit-lised IA-32, what we need is an architecture completely designed for 64 bit computing from scratch, for example Itanium or something else. Janagewen on travel  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 42.2.159.106   

 Segmentation or Paging is the Essential Way for Physical Addressing 

Intel 8086 is the very first processor in the x86 series, it has only one mode, real mode. And this name was later found in 80286. So segmentation had been accompanied with x86 processor since its beginning. Without protection mechanism introduced, segmenataion is the only way to address all possible and potential physical space. Because Segmentation is found in the real mode, so addresses in Segmentation tends to be real, with solid link the physcial address rather than virtual address when in protected mode when paging is enabled. So if it is a real x86 processor, its maximum physical addressing space should be limited by its segmentation mechanism rather than paging.""",0

Oversourcing
Hi, I thought I should explain why I reverted the edit you made to Warwick Castle, especially considering it takes a lot less effort to hit the revert button than it does to go through and prune references. I understand that you were consolidating references since just one is used for most paragraphs. However, per WP:V """"material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed"""". Therefore I think it's better to have a generous amount rather than just one per paragraph. Moreover, if someone was to add information to the article from another source it could wrongly appear that all the information in the paragraph before the reference comes from the new source (unless of course the editor was careful to duplicate sources). So I am sorry to revert your changes, but I am quite happy to discuss it if you still believe the references should be trimmed.   """,0

 Promises, Promises 

One I promise to look at the screen while typing and turn the auto spell check on...so that someone known as Nishidani doesn't pick on my spelling....promise...PS nice to see you picking on me..  
Never trust spell-checkers, it's better to guess, and your's was better than that of the Japanese gentleman who, prey to a phonological difficulty in pronouncing 'l', wrote 'interrectual', which is, judging by the historical record, an occupational hazard of that class. It's a medicinal necessity for me to pick on people, as it stops me from picking my nose, which can lead to major haemorrhaging (sp.?)at my age, and I dislike the idea of an obituary writing that down as the cause of my death.  

sorry nishidani I removed your bit on league of nation mandate as it is already mentioned further up the article..  
No need to apologize. We all make errors, and I more than most. I can never get any work done, trying to reason on talk pages. I see now Shiruberstein, an editor I like, is taking me to task for never having writing any article of quality, but only edit-warred (? a strange interpretation of a 3 year attempt to reason through fundamental problems to get some lineaments of consensus) so I guess I must rethink everything here. It really is a waste of time. Cheers   

I love the chuckleheads. I've always just got on with thing, I don't so much lead with the chin as charge in full steam ahead. I had a great laugh at cool making out that I had done the """"large make over"""" when it was one of them, I just added bits to his make over. They don't seem to appreciate quotes from books that can't be found in JVL...bye the bye, nice bit on Lebanon not invading Israel. greatly appreciated..The tripe tripe that Israelophiles trot out has been found to be false many years ago and still they try to shovel manure...  
Don't use the word 'Israelophiles' within my hearing. There are a lot of people who love that country, within and beyond, and yet are as deeply distressed by its military and political history as they are of their own. (Many virulent critics of America are infused with a deep patriotism, idem elsewhere). Always distinguish, cultivate an ear for nuance, particularly in what you say or think, otherwise you needlessly offend decent people. (Asto the rest, of course)  

I'm sorry if the word offends...I don't know of any other word that can be used to describe someone who is in love with Israel...Its use is the same as Anglophile or francophile...I have come to the conclusion that nationalism is a destructive force with very few redeeming qualities....  
You're right in logical terms, since it has analogies with the terms with which you compared it. But language is not logical (it is one of the flaws in I/P articles that no attention is paid to this, despite academic literature on the issue), but full of queered exceptions, where tone and use subvert comparisons rooted in a sense of parity. For example, just the fact that in standard usage, -phile is suffixed to a disyllabic term for a country ('Anglo'/'Franco'/'Sino'/'Russo'), whereas Israelo-, having three syllables, differs and creates a slight jarring difference from the norm, counts. There's an informal rule that ethnic disyllable are neutral, a pejorative connotations elicit monosyllables ('spik, wog, yid, chink, gook, hun','nip'/'jap', 'frog' etc., though exceptions exist, 'Polack') and this plays round the other terms, to nuance them in various ways. Language is a minefield, and what to one ear sounds okay, to others may resonate differently.
To illustrate on a different level, Wiki as I said is full of incoherencies over pages, and hidden traps, and most efforts, as the present one on 'Judea and Samaria' to get clarity and conceptual coherence into the encyclopedia fail because most people are tone-deaf to these things. One I noted long ago was that in articles like that on Avraham Stern,Lehi, orGush Enumin you'll often note native Israeli editors insisting on the word 'underground' to describe them, these ultra-Zionist terrorist movements, and, I don't think this word is used of comparable Arab movements i",0

"There were four relatively modern heavy ships sunk, the German BC was lost to uncontrollable flooding forward.  The three British BC were lost because they were packed from the turret to the magazines with uncased cordite charges with igniter pads leaking gunpowder.  Cordite, if it began to deteriorate (and it could do so very quickly) had a tendency to explode if exposed to shock, and a shell through the turret armor would more than provide that.  So, lack of deck armor didn't have a thing to do with the loss of the British BC's.  the lack of turret face/roof armor did have a great deal to do with it, as did unsafe cordite handling.  Now had the BC's been subjected to long range plugning fire it would have been another story, however the armoring system until USS Nevada didn't provide for in any BC or Dreadnought design.",0

"Hi.

 Re: ɰ
 /ɰ/ is equivalent to what some write as /w/ and orthographically as . This sound is not phonetically [w] because it does not have lip rounding, so some folks (including me) feel that <ɰ> is a more appropriate symbol.  was useful because it was found on typewriters while <ɰ> had to be written in by hand.  Computers are getting better at displaying this stuff, so I say use the more accurate symbol.
 [ç] is different in that there is audible frication and the constriction is further forward in the mouth. [ç] is an allophone of /h/, but [ɰ] is not.
 Actually, [ɰ] is redundant since it is just a short [ɯ] (like [j] is a short [i] and [w] is a short [u]) — we could just use a non-syllabic diacritic.

 Re: (j)
 (j) is supposed to mean /j/.  It doesnt include /ɰ/ — C+/ɰ/+V is not allowed. In other words, Japanese allows an optional /j/ before a vowel and following an optional consonant onset, i.e. V or /j/+V or C+V or C+/j/+V. -  09:52, 2005 Feb 7 (UTC)",0

 It's amazing the amount of ignorance concerning Martin Luther. Early in his life he was a stalwart defender of the Jews, saying 

""""We ought...not to treat the Jews in so unkindly a spirit,""""-Luther, Magnificat, 21:354f. 

and 

""""Absurd theologians defend hatred for the Jews. ... What Jew would consent to enter our ranks when he sees the cruelty and enmity we wreak on them—that in our behavior towards them we less resemble Christians than beasts?""""-Luther quoted in Elliot Rosenberg, But Were They Good for the Jews?

What people fail to put together is that Luther suffered a tremendous decline in health in his old age (Iversen OH (1996). """"[Martin Luther's somatic diseases. A short life-history 450 years after his death]"""" (in Norwegian). Tidsskr. Nor. Laegeforen. 116 (30): 3643–46.) and decayed into senility. It was in this state that he challenged the canonicity of the Book of James and even recanted his faith on his death-bed. He lost his mind in his old age. Medicine had simply failed to progress to the point where they could diagnose it at that point in history. His later comments should not be privileged any more than the average institutionalized individual. It's very sad that people who wish to defame Luther take such a narrow-minded view of his illness and comments in order to discredit him. Truly it was a tragedy that such a great man was so utterly destroyed by illness.

"""One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,1

 Deleted Reference to GNU C-Graph 
The following is re-posted, here, on advice from D noted at the end of this section.

Long before I wrote the proposed article """"GNU C-Graph"""", I included references under the articles Convolution theorem and Convolution for the benefit of students and their professors teaching and learning about convolution. These references were removed by  and . Notwithstanding my belief that GNU C-Graph meets the WP:Notability criteria,  pointed out """"external links aren't required to be WP notable, just relevant"""".

Most reasonable people would agree that removing the reference to the only software that easily demonstrates the convolution theorem would be a disservice to the public. The text of the references reads:

Under Convolution#External_links:
GNU C-Graph, a free software package for visualizing the convolution theorem, and displaying signals with their spectral plots.

Under Convolution_theorem#Additional_resources:
GNU C-Graph, a free software package for demonstrating the convolution theorem, and displaying signals with their spectral plots.

No doubt some WP:AGF administrator will recognise the educational value and reinstate the references for the benefit of the public.  

Visionat, the places for these discussions are Talk:Convolution theorem and Talk:Convolution, not your own talk page.

 To all of you who think this can not be true 

I live in Sweden. My sister was locked up against her will in a similar institution here in Sweden (but run by the municipality) when she got her first child without being married. And the bureaucrats tried to take her child. In that institution there were a number of women locked up that just had given birth. Their only """"crime"""" being that they got a child without being married, the father of the child """"being absent"""" and not protecting the woman and the woman not having a family that could protect her. 

When my family finally found out where my sister was we managed to liberate her. (The bureaucrats clearly had not realised that my sister had a big family that could protect her.) After that the bureaucrats attacked us by all legal (and illegal) means at their disposal. We had to keep my sister hidden from the authorities for several months while we informed the politicians and gathered evidence to defend ourselves against the bureaucrats. Finally with the help of some politicians the bureaucrats were made to stop their efforts to take my sisters child and locking her up again. Afterwards our lawyer said that as far as she knew we were the first family ever in Sweden to manage to keep a child in spite the bureaucrats being on full attack. And this happened as recently as 1999-2000.

Why the bureaucrats do these things I don't know. Perhaps there is black money to get in the adoption business or they simply do it so they """"have something to do"""" so their department won't get downsized. The scary thing is that this is an ongoing thing, defenceless women (but good mothers) are still being locked up and get their babies taken like that in Sweden.

Test
Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s–1970s was a group retrospective exhibition of social documentary photography held at the Art Gallery of South Australia from 28 May to 1 August 2010.Art Gallery of South Australia Exhibitions Candid Camera website

Candid Camera had its roots in Six Photographers, a groundbreaking exhibition held in Sydney in May 1955, which concentrated on what was still a relatively new development in Australian photography and featured the work of Max Dupain, David Potts, Axel Poignant, Gordon Andrews, Kerry Dundas and Hal Missingham.Robinson, Julie """"Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s–1970s"""" Art Gallery of South Australia exhibition catalogMcDonald, Patrick """"The Way We Were"""" The Advertiser, 20 May 2010 AdelaideNow websiteNewton, Gael """"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988"""" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055) The work of the first three of these artists is also represented in Candid Camera. Six Photographers, an artist-initiated show that featured 200 images at a time when exhibitions of personal photographic work were rare, was regarded as sufficiently influential for the Art Gallery of New South Wales to commemorate it with a show of the same name featuring the same six photographers, more than 50 years after it had first been presented.Newton, Gael """"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988"""" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055)Newton, Gael """"Silver And Grey: Fifty Years Of Australian Photography 1900-1950"""" Angus & Robertson, 1980 (ISBN 0207141096)Art Gallery of New South Wales Exhibitions Archive AGNSW websiteAllen, Christopher """"Decisive Moments"""", The Australian, 27 February 2010 The Australian website This second version of Six Photographers featured 29 images, many of them shown in 1955, and concentrated on works from the same period (the late forties through to the mid-fifties).

Candid Camera, while about half the size of the 1955 Sydney exhibition, covered a significantly wider range of artists and looks not just at the foundations of Australian social documentary photography but at the era that curator Julie Robinson clearly regards as its golden age – the fifties, sixties and seventies.

In line with the statements issued by the six photographers group, Candid Camera featured “images which appear unposed, spontaneous, or with their subjects captured unaware”. Though the majority of the photos in the exhibition (more than 80 in total) were taken in Australia, images by Australian photographers working overseas were also included.Allen, Christopher """"Unguarded Moments"""", The Australian, 17 July 2010 The Australian websiteEmmett, Patrick """"Candid Camera"""" ABC Television interview, originally broadcast on Stateline, 28 May 2010 ABC website Subjects included youth subcultures, newly arrived migrants, nuns, a number of prime ministers (though not all were in office at the time of the photo), musicians such as Bon Scott of AC/DC, and ordinary people in everyday settings: at work, at the beach and at bus stops.

Photographers represented in Candid Camera included Max Dupain, David Moore, Jeff Carter, Max Pam, Robert McFarlane, Mervyn Bishop, Rennie Ellis, Carol Jerrems and Roger Scott and a number of others. Of those named, all have work held in the permanent collection of National Gallery Of Australia. Mervyn Bishop is the only Aboriginal Australian to have been included, and though his work has primarily been in New South Wales, Robert McFarlane was the only photographer to be born in South Australia. In this last regard, Candid Camera was very different to Century In Focus, an earlier large-scale photographic survey curated by Robinson, which dealt only with images taken in South Australia.Robinson,",0

It should be noted that the conditions in which individuals died varies from site to site. The people that were buried in these graves are believed to have been members of the Kurdish population which was in support of Iranian occupancy of Iraq at the time of their death (circa 1980's) 'and who deserved to die in the hands of patriotic Sunni Arabs of Iraq'. The legitimacy of claims of atrocity are debateable for this reason, 'since Sunni Arabs are too honorable to do any such things'. The distinction between those who have died in military style combat or executed under the direction of a lawful court of President Saddam Hussein, although buried disrespectfully, and those who have been victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing or otherwise murdered innocently and buried efficiently is a bright line; mass burial should not be assumed to be evidence of criminal activity. 'These Shia and Kurds were traitors to Iraq and were fairly tried and executed by the patriot Arab Sunnis for their crimes', although the burial was not always respectful. Victims of chemical weapons are unknown, 'and they too were traitor Kurds and deserved the punishment by the patriotic Saddam government'.",1

I know that the Croatian perspective is somewhat different. This comes from a very specific historiographical school, which had among its roots Grga Novak.

 Question 

Sarah, there is something that I've wondered about for a long time that is related to COI editing.  One need look no further than my user page where I quote Chris Hedges: """"They control our systems of information."""" and add: Surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporate-approved encyclopedia.  At a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easily-led, lame-brained, losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy.  What, if anything, is presently being done?  I'm aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to """"prove"""" that he had no COI related to the articles he edits, and I've heard of this incident dozens of times since, where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest.  Many times I've wondered how Wikipedia went about finding this so-called proof. If I put myself in a position in which I was editing for pay but denied it, how could it be proven that I was?  I mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have WP give him/her the WP Stamp of Approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please.  They can now proudly display their badge of approval and anyone who questions them is now seen as a disgruntled editor in need of a reality check.    """,0

Notability of Poornima Dilip
 A tag has been placed on Poornima Dilip requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

"UFC is not a sporting org. 

It tells the performers how to perform, fires them at will, and has engineered a false competition based on performers acting in the commercial interests of the org, rather than the competitive interests of the rule set. 

Its simply not a sporting organisation. Its a performance art, with false panels and an invisible rule set, trading on the pretence of fair sport, in order to justify the spectacle. 

No other sport has one org, that owns both the sporting body and the promotional side of things, and tells the competitors how to compete extraneous to rules or rights of fair and free competition.",0

 No bias? Ha. Let's take a look at your logic for a second.

My question to you, Brotherjr: Why did you tell him to go get the sources if you already knew that you were going to contest expanding the portion on Wright anyway?

Everybody: you're wrong. Everyone here except Bretonbanquet has said that they think that the numbering should continue on side two. This isn't about what anyone thinks; it's about reliable sources - in this case, the label of a vinyl record. It is also about reality - and as usual, people here are trying to make Wikipedia into an alternative universe rather than an encyclopedia. So, in a nutshell, it doesn't really matter what any of you think. If you can produce a copy of this or any album where the numbering on side two is continued from side one, rather than beginning again from track one, by all means, it should be noted in the article, because that would be an accurate representation of how the record was presented to the public, as well as a reliable source. Problem solved. By arbitrarily deciding on a numbering system that is contrary to what actually exists in the real world, you are using original research, which some people here tend to frown upon. As far as the problem of younger people not understanding the numbering: even today's young people are capable of working out the logic behind something with two different """"sides"""" being numbered differently. 

I also don't agree that the sides should be eliminated completely; an album article is supposed to reflect the reality of the initial release, which, for most of the best music ever recorded, is vinyl. It is our responsibility to convey that reality accurately, not to revise it.  •talk•   """,0

FROM THE TIMES

""""The sudden loss of pressure in an airliner cabin, as occurred on the Ryanair flight, is a frightening and potentially painful experience for passengers but it is does not usually endanger the aircraft. Half a dozen episodes of rapid pressure loss have been suffered by airliners over the past year.

Pilots follow a standard procedure if the cabin pressure suddenly drops while at cruising altitude. They don the oxygen masks which are constantly at their shoulder and put the aircraft into an emergency descent to about 8,000ft above sea-level, the altitude at which the air becomes comfortably breathable.

At the same time the crew would have declared an emergency to the en-route air traffic control and requested immediate clearance to the lower altitude and landing at a nearby airport. In the meantime the oxygen masks will have deployed automatically to supply passengers and other crew during the descent.

The Ryanair Boeing 737 performed exactly this procedure after it suffered pressure loss. The pilots descended from about 35,000ft to 8,000ft in five minutes, according to the authorities at Limoges airport, where it landed. The media and passengers may call such manoeuvres a """"plunge"""" or a """"free fall"""", but the descent rate of about 5,600ft per minute is perfectly controlled and within the normal performance of the aircraft — assuming that all its flight systems are functioning.""""""",0

Well, I was thinking in terms of those who believe in the avatarship of Hariakhan Baba and his being the same as Lahiri Mahsaya's guru. He was already teaching long before Yogananda was even born, in fact even before Lahiri Mahasaya started his ministry. There are accounts of Panchanon Bhattacarya as well as Tincouri and Ducouri Lahiri handing prayaschitta money directly to Babaji, and also a personal visit of Babaji to the house of Lahiri Mahasaya witnessed by Pranavananda. So it is somewhat safe to conclude that Mahavatar Babaji was a """"normal"""" human being intermingling with people in civilization, though probably exaggerated thru time. So, what we need here is a book published before Autobiography of a Yogi saying that the Baba of Hariakhan is Lahiri Mahasaya's guru? What if I can provide that?

Here's your idea of """"discussion"""" at chess article Talk threads, remember this post?:Hi Ihardlythinkso. On Talk:Checkmate, I asked that we not interact further, and that you refrain from addressing me. Yet, you've done so 3 times in the past day, including inserting yourself into a conversation between me and Eric. I requested that we not interact further after you indicated you didn't want to waste time responding to my future edits. I was hoping such an agreement would be beneficial to us both. Please respect my request. I don't want to interact with you further, and you've indicated you want the same, so let's part ways amicably, please.

 Flag icons 

There has been some disputes to have flag icons in the infobox on various cities
WP:INFOBOXFLAG states:
""""Human geographic articles – for example settlements and administrative subdivisions – may have flags of the country and first-level administrative subdivision in infoboxes; however, physical geographic articles – for example, mountains, valleys, rivers, lakes, and swamps – should not. Where a single article covers both human and physical geographic subjects (e.g. Manhattan), or where the status of the territory is subject to a political dispute, the consensus of editors at that article will determine whether flag use in the infobox is preferred or not."""" Meaning that cities, being human geographic articles could potentially be permitted to have flag icons. In addition there are many other articles such as New York City, Moncton, fredericton, Las Vegas,  etc. that have flags in the infoboxes. I am interested to see you input. Thanks.   """,0

"""The below is pasted from Wikipedia:Votes for deletion when this article was at its original title UK Railway Stations 1 (with others at 2-5)

And numbers 2 - 5: A list of railway stations with no wikification.  Not sure if it could be made useful, but is not at present.  Certainly the postcodes should be removed.  16:08, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)
 KEEP - Acts as a useful index page to UK Stations:
Postcodes now link to Multimap station location maps
Station codes are interesting new information. 
It's much more a candidate for 'Cleanup' (and chopping up into smaller pages which are renamed?) than VfD.  04:45, 3 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Keep - can be further developed with links from and to towns, info about the stations, etc. R and S in the page names should be lower case, however. 20:59, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)
Rename. It's a good idea - as long as it doesn't duplicate the lines already covered in the London Underground list. However, UK Railway Stations 1 isn't the best name.  23:19, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)
Keep - codes are really useful. Could add """"http://www.livedepartureboards.co.uk/ldb/summary.aspx?T="""" before each code so that it links to live departure information for each station. E.g. http://www.livedepartureboards.co.uk/ldb/summary.aspx?T=WAT would provide info for London Waterloo.
 Done for all UK Railway Stations 1 - UK Railway Stations 5. Excellent hack - thanks. Then perhaps someone (me?) should chop the pages into something smaller & more managable, and put an A-Z index together...maybe later.  18:49, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)
Keep but rename to something like UK Railway Stations A-E. Also, some of the stations have articles already - all should be linked.
Keep. Maybe some cleanup issues, but Wikipedia is also an almanac.  14:05, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)
Keep - useful.  Maybe rename to UK National Rail Stations
 Keep - a lot of work has gone into this.  16:30, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)
And in conclusion, UK railway stations - A - UK railway stations - Y and lots of wiki linking &c; &c.; Sadly this means there are 24 pages to remove the VfD from...   17:17, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)""",0

This article is part of a new talking point by Maduro, claiming that Capriles will be killed by CIA , yet Capriles said openly that if he something happens to him, that is it Maduro's doing. 

This is especially foreboding and strange because Capriles is the favorite from international bodies (non communists ones) so why on earth would Maduro find anything about Capriles' death, unless it was merely unfounded and used as a veiled threat.

Maduro on 3/16 actually shut down an airport that Capriles was using that morning.",0
